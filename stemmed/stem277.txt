establish a transmiss control protocol tcp connect to a particular port on a server typic port occasion port see list of tcp and udp port number an http server listen on that port wait for a client s request messag upon receiv the request the server send back a statu line such as http ok and a messag of it own the bodi of thi messag is typic the request resourc although an error messag or other inform mai also be return http authent edit http provid multipl authent scheme such as basic access authent and digest access authent which oper via a challeng respons mechan wherebi the server identifi and issu a challeng befor serv the request content http provid a gener framework for access control and authent via an extens set of challeng respons authent scheme which can be us by a server to challeng a client request and by a client to provid authent inform authent realm edit the http authent spec also provid an arbitrari implement specif construct for further divid resourc common to a given root uri the realm valu string if present is combin with the canon root uri to form the protect space compon of the challeng thi in effect allow the server to defin separ authent scope under on root uri request method edit an http request made us telnet the request messag respons header section and respons bodi ar highlight http defin method sometim refer to as verb to indic the desir action to be perform on the identifi resourc what thi resourc repres whether pre exist data or data that is gener dynam depend on the implement of the server often the resourc correspond to

document their semant ar well known and can be depend upon ani client can us ani method and the server can be configur to support ani combin of method if a method is unknown to an intermedi it will be

method ask for a respons ident to that of a get request but without the respons bodi thi is us for retriev meta inform written in respons header without have to transport the entir content postth post method request that the server accept the entiti enclos in the request as a new subordin of the web resourc identifi by the uri the data post might be for exampl an annot for exist resourc a messag for a bulletin board newsgroup mail list or comment thread a block of data that is the result of submit a web form to a data handl process or an item to add to a databas putth put method request that the enclos entiti be store under the suppli uri if the uri refer to an alreadi exist resourc it is modifi if the uri doe not point to an exist resourc then the server can creat the resourc with that uri deleteth delet method delet the specifi resourc traceth trace method echo the receiv request so that a client can see what if ani chang or addit have been made by intermedi server optionsth option method return the http method that the server support for the specifi url thi can be us to check the function of a web server by request instead of a specif resourc connect the connect method convert the request connect to a transpar tcp ip tunnel usual to facilit ssl encrypt commun http through an unencrypt http proxi see http connect tunnel patchth patch method appli partial modif to a resourc all gener purpos http server ar requir to implement at least the get and head method and whenev possibl also the option method citat need safe method edit some of the method for exampl head get option and trace ar by convent defin as safe which mean thei ar intend onli for inform retriev and should not chang the state of the server in other word thei should not have side effect beyond rel harmless effect such as log cach the serv of banner advertis or increment a web counter make arbitrari get request without regard to the context of the applic s state should therefor be consid safe howev thi is not mandat by the standard and it is explicitli acknowledg that it cannot be guarante by contrast method such as post put delet and patch ar intend for action that mai caus side effect either on the server or extern side effect such as financi transact or transmiss of email such method ar therefor not usual us by conform web robot or web crawler some that do not conform tend to make request without regard to context or consequ despit the prescrib safeti of get request in practic their handl by the server is not technic limit in ani wai therefor careless or deliber program can caus non trivial chang on the server thi is discourag becaus it can caus problem for web cach search engin and other autom agent which can make unintend chang on the server idempot method and web applic edit method put and delet ar defin to be idempot mean that multipl ident request should have the same effect as a singl request note that idempot refer to the state of the system after the request ha complet so while the action the server take e g delet a record or the respons code it return mai be differ on subsequ request the system state will be the same everi time method get head option and trace be prescrib as safe should also be idempot as http is a stateless protocol in contrast the post method is not necessarili idempot and therefor send an ident post request multipl time mai further affect state or caus further side effect such as financi transact in some case thi mai be desir but in other case thi could be due to an accid such as when a user doe not realiz that their action will result in send anoth request or thei did not receiv adequ feedback that their first request wa success while web browser mai show alert dialog box to warn user in some case where reload a page mai re submit a post request it is gener up to the web applic to handl case where a post request should not be submit more than onc note that whether a method is idempot is not enforc by the protocol or web server it is perfectli possibl to write a web applic in which for exampl a databas insert or other non idempot action is trigger by a get or other request ignor thi recommend howev mai result in undesir consequ if a user agent assum that repeat the same request is safe when it isn t secur edit implement method such as trace track and debug ar consid potenti insecur by some secur profession becaus attack can us them to gather inform or bypass secur control dure attack secur softwar tool such as tenabl nessu and microsoft urlscan secur tool report on the presenc of these method as be secur issu track and debug ar not valid http verb statu code edit see also list of http statu code in http and sinc the first line of the http respons is call the statu line and includ a numer statu code such as and a textual reason phrase such as not found the wai the user agent handl the respons primarili depend on the code and secondarili on the other respons header field custom statu code can be us sinc if the user agent encount a code it doe not recogn it can us the first digit of the code to determin the gener class of the respons the standard reason phrase ar onli recommend and can be replac with local equival at the web develop s discret if the statu code indic a problem the user agent might displai the reason phrase to the user to provid further inform about the natur of the problem the standard also allow the user agent to attempt to interpret the reason phrase though thi might be unwis sinc the standard explicitli specifi that statu code ar machin readabl and reason phrase ar human readabl http statu code is primarili divid into five group for better explan of request and respons between client and server as name inform xx success xx redirect xx client error xx and server error xx persist connect edit main articl http persist connect in http and the connect is close after a singl request respons pair in http a keep aliv mechan wa introduc where a connect could be reus for more than on request such persist connect reduc request latenc percept becaus the client doe not need to re negoti the tcp wai handshak connect after the first request ha been sent anoth posit side effect is that in gener the connect becom faster with time due to tcp s slow start mechan version of the protocol also made bandwidth optim improv to http for exampl http introduc chunk transfer encod to allow content on persist connect to be stream rather than buffer http pipelin further reduc lag time allow client to send multipl request befor wait for each respons anoth improv to the protocol wa byte serv where a server transmit just the portion of a resourc explicitli request by a client http session state edit http is a stateless protocol a stateless protocol doe
