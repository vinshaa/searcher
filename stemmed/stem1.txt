each other and a web servic is a method of commun that allow two softwar system to exchang thi data over the internet the softwar system that request data is call a servic request wherea the softwar system that would process the request and provid the data is call a servic provid differ softwar mai us differ program languag and henc there is a need for a method of data exchang that doesn t depend upon a particular program languag most type of softwar can howev interpret xml tag thu web servic can us xml file for data exchang rule for commun between differ system need to be defin such as how on system can request data from anoth system which specif paramet ar need in the data requestwhat would be the structur of the data produc normal data is exchang in xml file and the structur of the xml file is valid against an xsd file what error messag to displai when a certain rule for commun is not observ to make troubleshoot easier all of these rule for commun ar defin in a file call wsdl web servic descript languag which ha a wsdl extens propos for autonom web servic aw seek to develop more flexibl web servic which do not reli on strict rule web servic architectur the servic provid send a wsdl file to uddi the servic request contact uddi to find out who is the provid for the data it need and then it contact the servic provid us the soap protocol the servic provid valid the servic request and send structur data in an xml file us the soap protocol thi xml file would be valid again by the servic request us an xsd file a directori call uddi univers descript discoveri and integr defin which softwar system should be contact for which type of data so when on softwar system need on particular report data it would go to the uddi and find out which other system it can contact for receiv that data onc the softwar system find out which other system it should contact it would then contact that system us a special protocol call soap simpl object access protocol the servic provid system would first valid the data request by refer to the wsdl file and then process the request and send the data under the soap protocol web api edit web servic in a servic orient architectur a web api is a develop in web servic where emphasi ha been move to simpler represent state transfer rest base commun rest api do not requir xml base web servic protocol soap and wsdl to support their interfac autom design method edit autom tool can aid in the creation of a web servic for servic us wsdl it is possibl to either automat gener wsdl for exist class a bottom up model or to gener a class skeleton given exist wsdl a top down model a develop us a bottom up model write implement class first in some program languag and then us a wsdl gener tool to expos method from these class as a web servic thi is simpler to develop but mai be harder to maintain if the origin class ar subject to frequent chang a develop us a top down model write the wsdl document first and then us a code gener tool to produc the class skeleton to be complet as necessari thi model is gener consid more difficult but can produc cleaner design and is gener more resist to chang as long as the messag format between sender and receiv do not chang chang in the sender and receiv themselv do not affect the web servic the techniqu is also refer to as contract first sinc the wsdl or contract between sender and receiv is the start point a develop us a subset wsdl swsdl i e a wsdl with the subset oper in the origin wsdl can perform web servic test and top down develop web servic that us markup languag edit
