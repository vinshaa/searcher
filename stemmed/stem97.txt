unsourc materi mai be challeng and remov august the creation of npapi wa motiv by adob system john warnock ceo of adob and allan padgett on of the primari author of acrobat reader were hope that adob s fledgl portabl document format pdf file format could plai a role beyond the desktop soon after netscap releas the first version of navig padgett and fellow develop eswar priyadarshan tri to find a wai to make pdf an integr part of the web experi the result wa a live demo shown to warnock and netscap ceo jim clark prior to that demo the onli nativ file format on the web were html page and embed imag link to other file type caus the user to be prompt to download the file after which the user could open the appropri applic in that demo howev when a user click on a link to a pdf file the file wa render within the browser window seamlessli blend html and pdf consumpt clark excitedli ask who at netscap had provid support for the integr onli to discov that the integr wa done without netscap involv but by revers engin the netscap browser the compani set out the next week to bring what wa known as allan s hack to market while netscap wa readi to incorpor pdf directli into the browser and certainli adob would have gain from that padgett propos hi plugin architectur adob develop gordon dow and nabeel al shamma had recent ad a plugin architectur to the acrobat reader to leverag the develop effort of develop outsid of the reader team padgett had been a part of that effort and he expect that if given a chanc other compani and hopefulli team within adob would choos to extend the web as well clark and team in the end were convinc and set off design the api that would support the new model in the follow year other web browser see browser support adopt npapi script support edit script is a featur allow javascript code in a web page to interact with the plugin variou version of netscap and then mozilla support thi featur us differ technolog includ liveconnect xpconnect and npruntim liveconnect edit main articl liveconnect with netscap npapi wa extend to allow plugin to be script thi extens is call liveconnect a plugin could implement a java class and expos an instanc of it the class could be call from javascript and from java applet run within the page the disadvantag of liveconnect is that it is heavili ti to the version of java embed within the netscap browser thi prevent the browser from us other java runtim and ad bloat to the browser download size sinc it requir java to script plugin addition liveconnect is tricki to program the develop ha to defin a java class for the plugin run it through a special java header compil and implement the nativ method handl string except and other java object from c is non obviou in addit liveconnect us an earlier and now obsolet applic program interfac api for invok nativ c call from java call jri the jri technolog ha long sinc been supplant by jni xpconnect edit main articl xpconnect liveconnect wa problemat for mozilla the depend on an obsolet and proprietari java runtim and the jri api meant that liveconnect never realli work mozilla wa alreadi us xpcom to defin the interfac to mani object implement in c each interfac wa defin by an idl file and run through an idl compil that produc header file and a languag neutral type librari that wa a binari represent of the interfac thi binari describ the interfac the method the paramet the data structur and enumer xpconnect us the type librari inform to marshal call between differ thread context and between javascript and nativ compil c xpconnect is us extens throughout mozilla start with netscap and mozilla npapi wa extend so that a plugin could return a scriptabl interfac to itself and xpconnect would marshal call to it from javascript and the c implement xpconnect ha no java depend howev the technolog is base on xpcom thu the plugin develop must be familiar with refer count interfac and idl to implement script the depend on xpcom led to certain dynam link issu e g the fragil base class problem which had to be solv befor the plugin would work correctli with differ browser xpcom ha sinc been chang to suppli a static link version to address such issu thi approach also requir an xpt file to be instal next to the dynam link librari dll otherwis the plugin appear to work but the script doe not caus confus npruntim edit at the end of all major browser compani us npapi agre on npruntim as an extens to the origin npapi to suppli script via an api that is similar in style to the old c style npapi and is independ of other browser
