develop by mozilla research it is design to be a safe concurr practic languag support pure function concurr actor dubiou discuss citat need imper procedur and object orient style the languag grew out of a person project by mozilla employe graydon hoar mozilla began sponsor the project in and announc it for the first time in the same year work shift from the initi compil written in ocaml to the self host compil written in rust known as rustc it successfulli compil itself in the self host compil us llvm as it back end the first number pre alpha releas of the rust compil occur in januari rust the first stabl releas wa releas on mai rust is develop entir in the open and solicit feedback and contribut from the commun the design of the languag ha been refin through the experi of write the servo layout engin and the rust compil although it develop is sponsor by mozilla it is a commun project a larg portion of current commit ar from commun member content design syntax histori name origin see also refer extern link design edit the goal of rust is to be a good languag for creat highli concurr and highli safe system thi ha led to a featur set with an emphasi on safeti control of memori layout and concurr perform of safe code is expect to be slower than c if perform is the onli consider but to be compar to c code that manual take precaut compar to what the rust languag mandat the syntax of rust is similar to c and c with block of code delimit by curli bracket and control flow keyword such as if els while and for not all c or c keyword ar present howev while other such as the match keyword for multi direct branch similar to switch in other languag will be less familiar to programm come from these languag despit the syntact resembl rust is semant veri differ from c and c the system is design to be memori safe and it doe not permit null pointer or dangl pointer data valu can onli be initi through a fix set of form all of which requir their input to be alreadi initi a system of pointer lifetim and freez allow the compil to prevent mani type of error that ar possibl to write in c even when us it smart pointer the type system support a mechan similar to type class call trait inspir directli by the haskel languag thi is a facil for ad hoc polymorph achiev by ad constraint to type variabl declar other featur from haskel such as higher kind polymorph ar not yet support rust doe not us an autom garbag collect system like java or net rust featur type infer for variabl declar with the let keyword such variabl do not requir a valu to be initi assign in order to determin their type a compil time error result if ani branch of code fail to assign a valu to the variabl function can be given gener paramet but thei must be explicitli bound by trait there is no wai to leav off type signatur while still make us of method and oper on the paramet the object system within rust is base around implement trait and structur type implement fulfil a role similar to that of class within other languag and ar defin with the impl keyword inherit and polymorph ar provid by trait thei allow method to be defin and mix in to implement structur type ar us to defin field implement and trait cannot defin field themselv and onli trait can provid inherit in order to prevent the diamond inherit problem of c syntax edit thi section mai need to be rewritten entir to compli with wikipedia s qualiti standard you can help the discuss page mai contain suggest octob hello world fn main println hello world three version of the factori function in recurs iter and iter style
