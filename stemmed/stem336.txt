antoninu made few initi chang when he becam emperor leav intact as far as possibl the arrang institut by hadrian a non militari reign edit there ar no record of ani militari relat act in hi time in which he particip on modern scholar ha written it is almost certain not onli that at no time in hi life did he ever see let alon command a roman armi but that throughout the twenti three year of hi reign he never went within five hundr mile of a legion hi reign wa the most peac in the entir histori of the princip while there were sever militari disturb throughout the empir in hi time in mauretania where cavalri reinforc from panonnia where brought in the town of tipasa be fortifi as well as in iudaea and amongst the brigant in britannia none of them ar consid seriou it wa howev in

empir wa barren therefor strain suppli line and not worthi hold to on a cost benefit analysi it ha been therefor especul that the invas of lowland scotland and the build of the wall had to do mostli with intern polit that is offer antoninu an opportun to gain some modicum of necessari militari prestig at the start of hi reign actual the campaign in britannia wa follow by an imperi salut that is by antoninu formal take for the second and last time the titl of imper in the fact that around the same time coin were struck announc a victori in britain point to antoninu need to public hi achiev that thi quest for some militari achiev respond to an actual need is prove by the fact that although gener peac antoninu reign wa not free from attempt of usurp historia augusta mention two made by senat corneliu priscianu by the wai lolliu urbicu successor as governor of britain and atiliu rufiu titianu both confirm by the fasti ostiens as well as by the eras of priscianu name on a inscript in
