regard to whether anarcho capitalist societi is justifi on deontolog or consequentialist ethic or both natur law anarcho capit as advoc by rothbard hold that a univers system of right can be deriv from natur law some other anarcho capitalist do not reli upon the idea of natur right but instead present econom justif for a free market capitalist societi such a latter approach ha been offer by david d friedman in the machineri of freedom also unlik other anarcho capitalist most notabl rothbard friedman ha never tri to deni the theoret cogenc of the neoclass literatur on market failur but

natur of the contractu mechan that abolish the state or prevent it from come into exist where new commun form anarcho capit and other anarchist school edit main articl anarch and anarcho capit anarch in both it collectivist and individualist form is usual consid a radic left wing and anti capitalist ideolog that promot socialist econom theori such as commun syndic and mutual these anarchist believ capit is incompat with social and econom equal and therefor do not recogn anarcho capit as an anarchist school of thought in particular thei argu that capitalist transact ar not voluntari and that maintain the class structur of a capitalist societi requir coercion which is incompat with an anarchist societi murrai rothbard argu that the capitalist system of todai is inde not properli anarchist becaus it so often collud with the state accord to rothbard what marx and later writer have done is to lump togeth two extrem differ and even contradictori concept and action under the same portmanteau term these two contradictori concept ar what i would call free market capit on the on hand and state capit on the other the differ between free market capit and state capit write rothbard is precis the differ between on the on hand peac voluntari exchang and on the other violent expropri he continu state capit inevit creat all sort of problem which becom insolubl rothbard maintain that anarcho capit is the onli true form of anarch the onli form of anarch that could possibl exist in realiti as he argu ani other form presuppos an authoritarian enforc of polit ideolog such as redistribut of privat properti accord to thi argument the free market is simpli the natur situat that would result from peopl be free from author and entail the establish of all voluntari associ in societi cooper non profit organ busi etc moreov anarcho capitalist as well as classic liber minarchist argu that the applic of left wing anarchist ideal would requir an authoritarian bodi of some sort to impos it in order to forcefulli prevent peopl from accumul privat capit there would necessarili be a redistribut organ of some sort which would have the author to in essenc exact a tax and re alloc the result resourc to a larger group of peopl thi bodi would thu inher have polit power and would be noth short of a state the differ between such an arrang and an anarcho capitalist system is precis the voluntari natur of organ within anarcho capit contrast with a central ideolog and a pair enforc mechan which would be necessari under a coerciv egalitarian anarchist system howev rothbard also wrote a piec publish posthum entitl ar libertarian anarchist where he trace the etymolog root of anarchist philosophi ultim come to the conclus that we find that all of the current anarchist ar irrat collectivist and therefor at opposit pole from our posit that none of the proclaim anarchist group correspond to the libertarian posit that even the best of them have unrealist and socialist element in their doctrin and furthermor we must therefor conclud that we ar not anarchist and that those who call us anarchist ar not on firm etymolog ground and ar be complet unhistor on the other hand it is clear that we ar not archist either we do not believ in establish a tyrann central author that will coerc the noninvas as well as the invas perhap then we could call ourselv by a new name nonarchist histori edit classic liber edit main articl classic liber classic liber is the primari influenc with the longest histori on anarcho capitalist theori classic liber have had two main theme sinc john lock first expound the philosophi the liberti of man and limit of state power the liberti of man wa express in term of natur right while limit the state wa base for lock on a consent theori in the th centuri classic liber led the attack against statism on notabl wa frédéric bastiat the law who wrote the state is the great fiction by which everybodi seek to live at the expens of everybodi els henri david thoreau wrote i heartili accept the motto that govern is best which govern least and i should like to see it act up to more rapidli and systemat carri out it final amount to thi which also i believ that govern is best which govern not at all and when men ar prepar for it that will be the kind of govern which thei will have the earli liber believ that the state should confin it role to protect individu liberti and properti and oppos all but the most minim econom regul the norm core of classic liber is the idea that in an environ of laissez fair a spontan order of cooper in exchang good and servic emerg that satisfi human want some individualist came to realiz that the liber state itself take properti forcefulli through taxat in order to fund it protect servic and therefor it seem logic inconsist to oppos theft while also support a tax fund protector so thei advoc what mai be seen as classic liber taken to the extrem by onli support voluntarili fund defens by compet privat provid on of the first liber to discuss the possibl of privat protect of individu liberti and properti wa franc s jakob mauvillon in the th centuri later in the s juliu faucher and gustav de molinari advoc the same molinari in hi essai the product of secur argu no govern should have the right to prevent anoth govern from go into competit with it or to requir consum of secur to come exclus to it for thi commod molinari and thi new type of anti state liber ground their reason on liber ideal and classic econom historian and libertarian ralph raico argu that what these liber philosoph had come up with wa a form of individualist anarch or as it would be call todai anarcho capit or market anarch unlik the liber of lock which saw the state as evolv from societi the anti state liber saw a fundament conflict between the voluntari interact of peopl societi and the institut of forc the state thi societi versu state idea wa express in variou wai natur societi vs artifici societi liberti vs author societi of contract vs societi of author and industri societi vs milit societi just to name a few the anti state liber tradit in europ and the unit state continu after molinari in the earli write of herbert spencer as well as in thinker such as paul émile de puydt and auberon herbert later in the earli th centuri the mantl of anti state liber wa taken by the old right these were minarchist anti war anti imperialist and later anti new dealer some of the most notabl member of the old right were albert jai nock rose wilder lane isabel paterson frank chodorov garet garrett and h l mencken in the s the new fusion conservat also call cold war conservat took hold of the right wing in the u s stress anti commun thi induc the libertarian old right to split off from the right and seek allianc with the now left wing antiwar movement and to start specif libertarian organ such as the u s libertarian parti nineteenth centuri individualist anarch in the unit state edit lysand spooner rothbard wa influenc by the work of the th centuri american individualist anarchist who were also influenc by classic liber in the winter of influenc by sever th centuri individualist anarchist rothbard decid to reject minim state laissez fair and embrac individualist anarch rothbard said in lysand spooner and benjamin r tucker were unsurpass as polit philosoph and noth is more need todai than a reviv and develop of the larg forgotten legaci thei left to polit philosophi howev he thought thei had a faulti understand of econom the th centuri individualist had a labor theori of valu as influenc by the classic economist but rothbard wa a student of austrian econom which doe not agre with the labor theori of valu so rothbard sought to meld th centuri american individualist advocaci of free market and privat defens with the principl of austrian econom there is in the bodi of thought known as austrian econom a scientif explan of the work of the free market and of the consequ of govern intervent in that market which individualist anarchist could easili incorpor into their polit and social weltanschauung rothbard held that the econom consequ of the polit system thei advoc would not result in an economi with peopl be paid in proport to labor amount nor would profit and interest disappear as thei expect tucker thought that unregul bank and monei issuanc would caus increas in the monei suppli so that interest rate would drop to zero or near to it rothbard disagre with thi as he explain in the spooner tucker doctrin an economist s view he sai that first of all tucker wa wrong to think that that would caus the monei suppli to increas becaus he sai that the monei suppli in a free market would be self regul if it were not then inflat would occur so it is not necessarili desir to increas the monei suppli in the first place secondli he sai that tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless becaus peopl in gener do not wish to lend their monei to other without compens so there is no reason why thi would chang just becaus bank wa unregul also tucker held a labor theori of valu as a result he thought that in a free market that peopl would be paid in proport to how much labor thei exert and that if thei were not then exploit or usuri wa take place as he explain in state social and anarch hi theori wa that unregul bank would caus more monei to be avail and that thi would allow prolifer of new busi which would in turn rais demand for labor thi led him to believ that the labor theori of valu would be vindic and equal amount of labor would receiv equal pai again as a neoclass economist rothbard did not agre with the labor theori he believ that price of good and servic ar proport to margin util rather than to labor amount in free market and he did not think that there wa anyth exploit about peopl receiv an incom accord to how much buyer of their servic valu their labor or what that labor produc benjamin tucker oppos vast concentr of wealth which he believ were made possibl by govern intervent and state protect monopoli he believ the most danger state intervent wa the requir that individu obtain charter in order to oper bank and what he believ to be the illeg of issu privat monei which he believ caus capit to concentr in the hand of a privileg few which he call the bank monopoli he believ anyon should be abl to engag in bank that wish without requir state permiss and issu privat monei though he wa support of laissez fair late in life he said that state intervent had allow some extrem concentr of resourc to such a degre that even if laissez fair were institut it would be too late for competit to be abl to releas those resourc he gave standard oil as an exampl anarcho capitalist also oppos government restrict on bank thei like all austrian economist believ that monopol is facilit and expand through govern intervent th centuri american individualist anarchist such as tucker and lysand spooner have long argu that monopoli on credit and land interfer with the function of a free market economi of particular import to anarcho capitalist and tucker and spooner ar the idea of sovereignti of the individu a market economi and the opposit to collectiv a defin point upon which thei agre is that defens of liberti and properti should be provid in the free market rather than by the state tucker said d efens is a servic like ani other servic that it is labor both us and desir and therefor an econom commod subject to the law of suppli and demand that in a free market thi commod would be furnish at the cost of product that competit prevail patronag would go to those who furnish the best articl at the lowest price that the product and sale of thi commod ar now monopol by the state and
