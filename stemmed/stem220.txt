link histori edit lua wa creat in by roberto ierusalimschi luiz henriqu de figueiredo and waldemar cele member of the comput graphic technolog group tecgraf at the pontif cathol univers of rio de janeiro in brazil from until brazil had a polici of strong trade barrier call a market reserv for comput hardwar and softwar in that atmospher tecgraf s client could not afford either polit or financi to bui custom softwar from abroad those reason led tecgraf to implement the basic tool it need from scratch lua s histor father and mother were the data descript configur languag sol simpl object languag and del data entri languag thei had been independ develop at tecgraf in to add some flexibl into two differ project both were interact graphic program for engin applic at petrobra compani there wa a lack of ani flow control structur in sol and del and petrobra felt a grow need to add full program power to them as the languag s author wrote in the evolut of lua in the onli real contend wa tcl which had been explicitli design to be embed into applic howev tcl had unfamiliar syntax did not offer good support for data descript and ran onli on unix platform we did not consid lisp or scheme becaus of their unfriendli syntax python wa still in it infanc in the free do it yourself atmospher that then reign in tecgraf it wa quit natur that we should try to develop our own script languag becaus mani potenti user of the languag were not profession programm the languag should avoid cryptic syntax and semant the implement of the new languag should be highli portabl becaus tecgraf s client had a veri divers collect of comput platform final sinc we expect that other tecgraf product would also need to emb a script languag the new languag should follow the exampl of sol and be provid as a librari with a c api lua wa design in such a wai that it object constructor be then slightli differ from the current light and flexibl style incorpor the data descript syntax of sol henc the name lua sol is portugues for sun lua is moon lua syntax for control structur wa mostli borrow from modula if while repeat until but also had taken influenc from clu multipl assign and multipl return from function call as a simpler altern to refer paramet or explicit pointer c neat idea of allow a local variabl to be declar onli where we need it snobol and awk associ arrai in an articl publish in dr dobb s journal lua s creator also state that lisp and scheme with their singl ubiquit data structur mechan the list were a major influenc on their decis to develop the tabl as the primari data structur of lua lua semant have been increasingli influenc by scheme over time especi with the introduct of anonym function and full lexic scope version of lua prior to version were releas under a licens similar to the bsd licens from version onward lua ha been licens under the mit licens both ar permiss free softwar licenc and ar almost ident featur edit lua is commonli describ as a multi paradigm languag provid a small set of gener featur that can be extend to fit differ problem type rather than provid a more complex and rigid specif to match a singl paradigm lua for instanc doe not contain explicit support for inherit but allow it to be implement with metat similarli lua allow programm to implement namespac class and other relat featur us it singl tabl implement first class function allow the employ of mani techniqu from function program and full lexic scope allow fine grain inform hide to enforc the principl of least privileg in gener lua strive to provid flexibl meta featur that can be extend as need rather than suppli a featur set specif to on program paradigm as a result the base languag is light the full refer interpret is onli about kb compil and easili adapt to a broad rang of applic lua is a dynam type languag intend for us as an extens or script languag and is compact enough to fit on a varieti of host platform it support onli a small number of atom data structur such as boolean valu number doubl precis float point by default and string typic data structur such as arrai set list and record can be repres us lua s singl nativ data structur the tabl which is essenti a heterogen associ arrai lua implement a small set of advanc featur such as first class function garbag collect closur proper tail call coercion automat convers between string and number valu at run time coroutin cooper multitask and dynam modul load by includ onli a minimum set of data type lua attempt to strike a balanc between power and size exampl code edit the classic hello world program can be written as follow print hello world it can also be written as io write hello world n or the exampl given on the lua websit io write hello world from version n comment us the follow syntax similar to that of ada eiffel haskel sql and vhdl a comment in lua start with a doubl hyphen and run to the end of the line multi line string comment ar adorn with doubl squar bracket comment like thi can have other comment nest the factori function is implement as a function in thi exampl function factori n local x for i n do x x i end return x end loop edit lua ha four type of loop the while loop the repeat loop similar to a do while loop the numer for loop and the gener for loop condit true while condit do statement end repeat statement until condit for i first last delta do delta mai be neg allow the for loop to count down or up statement exampl print i end the gener for loop for kei valu in pair g do print kei valu end would iter over the tabl g us the standard iter function pair until it return nil function edit lua s treatment of function as first class valu is shown in the follow exampl where the print function s behavior is modifi do local oldprint print store current print function as oldprint function print s redefin print function the usual print function can still be us through oldprint the new on ha onli on argument oldprint s foo and bar or s end end ani futur call to print will now be rout through the new function and becaus of lua s lexic scope the old print function will onli be access by the new modifi print lua also support closur as demonstr below function addto x return a new function that add x to the argument return function y when we refer to the variabl x which is outsid of the current scope and whose lifetim would be shorter than that of thi anonym function lua creat a closur return x y end end fourplu addto print fourplu print thi can also be achiev by call the function in the follow wai print addto thi is becaus we ar call the return function from addto with the argument directli thi also help to reduc data cost and up perform if be call iter a new closur for the variabl x is creat everi time addto is call so that each new anonym function return will alwai access it own x paramet the closur is manag by lua s garbag collector just like ani other object tabl edit tabl ar the most import data structur and by design the onli built in composit data type in lua and ar the foundat of all user creat type thei ar conceptu similar to associ arrai in php dictionari in python and hash in rubi or perl a tabl is a collect of kei and data pair where the data is referenc by kei in other word it s a hash heterogen associ arrai a kei index can be ani valu but nil and nan a numer kei of is consid distinct from a string kei of tabl ar creat us the constructor syntax a tabl creat a new empti tabl tabl ar alwai pass by refer see call by share a tabl x creat a new tabl with on entri map x to the number print a tabl x print the valu associ with the string kei in thi case b tabl a tabl b tabl x the valu in the tabl ha been chang to print b tabl x print print a tabl x also print becaus a tabl and b tabl both refer to the same tabl as record edit a tabl is often us as structur or record by us string as kei becaus such us is veri common lua featur a special syntax for access such field exampl point x y creat new tabl print point x print print point x ha exactli the same mean as line abov the easier to read dot notat is just syntact sugar quot the lua refer manual the syntax var name is just syntact sugar for var name as namespac edit by us a tabl to store relat function it can act as a namespac point point new function x y return x x y y return x x y y end point set x function point x point x x point x x end as arrai edit by us a numer kei the tabl resembl an arrai data type lua arrai ar base the first index is rather than as it is for mani other program languag though an explicit index of is allow a simpl arrai of string arrai a b c d indic ar assign automat print arrai print b automat index in lua start at print arrai print is the length oper for tabl and string arrai z zero is a legal index print arrai still print as lua arrai ar base the length of a tabl t is defin to be ani integ index n such that t n is not nil and t n is nil moreov if t is nil n can be zero for a regular arrai with non nil valu from to a given n it length is exactli that n the index of it last valu if the arrai ha hole that is nil valu between other non nil valu then t can be ani of the indic that directli preced a nil valu that is it mai consid ani such nil valu as the end of the arrai a two dimension tabl examplet print examplet print print examplet print an arrai of object function point x y point object constructor return x x y y creat and return a new object tabl end arrai point point point creat arrai of point arrai x y x y x y print arrai y print us a hash map to emul an arrai normal is slower than us an actual arrai howev lua tabl ar optim for us as arrai to help avoid thi issu metat edit extens semant is a kei featur of lua and the metat concept allow lua s tabl to be custom in power wai the follow exampl demonstr an infinit tabl for ani fib n will give the th fibonacci number us dynam program and memoiz fib initi valu for fib and fib setmetat fib index function valu n index is a function predefin by lua it is call if kei n doe not exist valu n valu n valu n calcul and memoiz fib n return valu n end object orient program edit although lua doe not have a built in concept of class thei can be implement us two languag featur first class function and tabl by place function and relat data into a tabl an object is form inherit both singl and multipl can be implement via the metat mechan tell the object to look up nonexist method and field in parent object s there is no such concept as class with these techniqu rather prototyp ar us as in the program languag self or javascript new object ar creat either with a factori method that construct new object from scratch or by clone an exist object lua provid some syntact sugar to facilit object orient to declar member function insid a prototyp tabl on can us function tabl func arg which is equival to function tabl func self arg call class method also make us of the colon object func arg is equival to object func object arg creat a basic vector object local vector vector index vector function vector new x y z the constructor return setmetat x x y y z z vector end function vector magnitud anoth method refer the implicit object us self return math sqrt self x self y self z end local vec vector new creat a vector print vec magnitud call a method output print vec x access a member variabl output intern edit lua program ar not interpret directli from the textual lua file but ar compil into bytecod which is then run on the lua virtual machin the compil process is typic invis to the user and is perform dure run time but it can be done offlin in order to increas load perform or reduc the memori footprint of the host environ by leav out the compil lua bytecod can also be produc and execut from within lua us the dump function from the string librari and the load loadstr loadfil function respect like most cpu and unlik most virtual machin which ar stack base the lua vm is regist base and therefor more close resembl an actual hardwar design the regist architectur both avoid excess copi of valu and reduc the total number of instruct per function the virtual machin of lua is on of the first regist base pure vm to have a wide us perl s parrot and android s dalvik ar two other well known regist base vm thi exampl is the bytecod list of the factori function defin abov as shown by the luac compil function factori lua instruct byte at x c param slot upvalu local constant function loadk loadk move loadk forprep to mul forloop to return return c api edit lua is intend to be embed into other applic and provid a c api for thi purpos the api is divid into two part the lua core and the lua auxiliari librari the lua api s design elimin the need for manual refer manag in c code unlik python s api the api like the languag is minimalist advanc function is provid by the auxiliari librari which consist larg of preprocessor macro which assist with complex tabl oper stack edit the lua c api is stack base lua provid function to push and pop most simpl c data type integ float etc to and from the stack as well as function for manipul tabl through the stack the lua stack is somewhat differ from a tradit stack the stack can be index directli for exampl neg indic indic offset from the top of the stack for exampl is the top most recent push valu while posit indic indic offset from the bottom oldest valu marshal data between c and lua function is also done us the stack to call a lua function argument ar push onto the stack and then the lua call is us to call the actual function when write a c function to be directli call from lua the argument ar pop from the stack exampl edit here is an exampl of call a lua function from c includ stdio h includ lua h lua main
