request to a web server and load the server respons data back into the script develop version of all major browser support uri scheme beyond http and http in particular blob url ar support data from the respons can be us to alter the current document in the browser window without load a new web page and despit the name of the api thi data can be in the form of not onli xml but also json html or plain text the respons data can also be evalu by client side script for exampl if it wa format as json by the web server it can be convert into a client side data object for further us the ajax web develop techniqu us by mani websit to implement respons and dynam web applic depend on xmlhttprequest for secur reason xmlhttprequest request follow the browser s same origin polici and will therefor onli succe if thei ar made to the host that serv the origin web page content histori and support support in internet explor version and http request the open method the setrequesthead method the send method the onreadystatechang event listen the abort method the http respons cross domain request see also refer extern link specif browser other histori and support edit the concept behind the xmlhttprequest object wa origin creat by the develop of outlook web access by microsoft for microsoft exchang server an interfac call ixmlhttprequest wa develop and implement into the second version of the msxml librari us thi concept the second version of the msxml librari wa ship with internet explor in march allow access via activex to the ixmlhttprequest interfac us the xmlhttp wrapper of the msxml librari the mozilla project develop and implement an interfac call nsixmlhttprequest into the gecko layout engin thi interfac wa model to work as close to microsoft s ixmlhttprequest interfac as possibl mozilla creat a wrapper to us thi interfac through a javascript object which thei call xmlhttprequest the xmlhttprequest object wa access as earli as gecko version releas on decemb of but it wa not complet function until as late as version of gecko releas on june the xmlhttprequest object becam a de facto standard in other major web client implement in safari releas in februari konqueror opera releas in april and icab b releas in septemb the world wide web consortium publish a work draft specif for the xmlhttprequest object on april edit by ann van kesteren of opera softwar and dean jackson of w c it goal is to document a minimum set of interoper featur base on exist implement allow web develop to us these featur without platform specif code the last revis to the xmlhttprequest object specif wa on novemb of be a last call work draft microsoft ad the xmlhttprequest object identifi to it script languag in internet explor releas in octob with the advent of cross browser javascript librari such as jqueri and the prototyp javascript framework develop can invok xmlhttprequest function without code directli to the api prototyp provid an asynchron request object call ajax request that wrap the browser s underli implement and provid access to it jqueri object repres or wrap element from the current client side dom thei all have a load method that take a uri paramet and make an xmlhttprequest to that uri then by default place ani return html into the html element repres by the jqueri object the w c ha sinc publish anoth work draft specif for the xmlhttprequest object xmlhttprequest level on februari of level consist of extend function to the xmlhttprequest object includ but not limit to progress event support for cross site request and the handl of byte stream the latest revis of the xmlhttprequest level specif is that of august which is still a work draft as of decemb updat xmlhttprequest version ha been merg into the main xmlhttprequest specif and there is no longer a version and a version support in internet explor version and edit internet explor version and did not defin the xmlhttprequest object identifi in their script languag as the xmlhttprequest identifi itself wa not standard at the time of their releas backward compat can be achiev through object detect if the xmlhttprequest identifi doe not exist web page that us xmlhttprequest or xmlhttp can mitig the current minor differ in the implement either by encapsul the xmlhttprequest object in a javascript wrapper or by us an exist framework that doe so in either case the wrapper should detect the abil of current implement and work within it requir until april microsoft support window xp and so internet explor a javascript encapsul exampl is provid below provid the xmlhttprequest constructor for internet explor x x other browser includ internet explor x x do not redefin xmlhttprequest if it alreadi exist thi exampl is base on find at http blog msdn com xmlteam archiv us the right version of msxml in internet explor aspx if typeof xmlhttprequest undefin xmlhttprequest function try return new activexobject msxml xmlhttp catch e try return new activexobject msxml xmlhttp catch e try return new activexobject microsoft xmlhttp catch e throw new error thi browser doe not support xmlhttprequest http request edit thi section doe not cite ani refer or sourc pleas help improv thi section by ad citat to reliabl sourc unsourc materi mai be challeng and remov octob the follow section demonstr how a request us the xmlhttprequest object function within a conform user agent base on the w c work draft as the w c standard for the xmlhttprequest object is still a draft user agent mai not abid by all the function of the w c definit and ani of the follow is subject to chang extrem care should be taken into consider when script with the xmlhttprequest object across multipl user agent thi articl will try to list the inconsist between the major user agent the open method edit thi articl mai be confus or unclear to reader pleas help us clarifi the articl suggest mai be found on the talk page octob the http and http request of the xmlhttprequest object must be initi through the open method thi method must be invok prior to the actual send of a request to valid and resolv the request method url and uri user inform to be us for the request thi method doe not assur that the url exist or the user inform is correct thi method can accept up to five paramet but requir onli two to initi a request open method url asynchron usernam password the first paramet of the method is a text string indic the http request method to us the request method that must be support by a conform user agent defin by the w c draft for the xmlhttprequest object ar current list as the follow get support by internet explor and later mozilla post support by internet explor and later mozilla and later head support by internet explor and later putdeleteopt support by internet explor and later howev request method ar not limit to the on list abov the w c draft state that a browser mai support addit request method at their own discret the second paramet of the method is anoth text string thi on indic the url of the http request the w c recommend that browser should rais an error and not allow the request of a url with either a differ port or ihost uri compon from the current document the third paramet a boolean valu indic whether or not the request will be asynchron is not a requir paramet by the w c draft the default valu of thi paramet should be assum to be true by a w c conform user agent if it is not provid an asynchron request true will not wait on a server respons befor continu on with the execut of the current script it will instead invok the onreadystatechang event listen of the xmlhttprequest object throughout the variou stage of the request a synchron request fals howev will block execut of the current script until the request ha been complet thu not invok the onreadystatechang event listen the fourth and fifth paramet ar the usernam and password respect these paramet or just the usernam mai be provid for authent and author if requir by the server for thi request the setrequesthead method edit upon success initi of a request the setrequesthead method of the xmlhttprequest object can be invok to send http header with the request setrequesthead name valu the first paramet of thi method is the text string name of the header the second paramet is the text string valu thi method must be invok for each header that need to be sent with the request ani header attach here will be remov the next time the open method is invok in a w c conform user agent the send method edit to send an http request the send method of the xmlhttprequest must be invok thi method accept a singl paramet contain the content to be sent with the request send data thi paramet mai be omit if no content need to be sent the w c draft state that thi paramet mai be ani type avail to the script languag as long as it can be turn into a text string with the except of the dom document object if a user agent cannot serialis the paramet then the paramet should be ignor firefox x and previou version will howev throw an except if send is call without an argument if the paramet is a dom document object a user agent should assur the document is turn into well form xml us the encod indic by the inputencod properti of the document object if the content type request header wa not ad through setrequesthead yet it should automat be ad by a conform user agent as applic xml charset charset where charset is the encod us to encod the document if the user agent is configur to us a proxi server then the xmlhttprequest object will modifi the request appropri so as to connect to the proxi instead of the origin server and send proxi author header as configur the onreadystatechang event listen edit if the open method of the xmlhttprequest object wa invok with the third paramet set to true for an asynchron request the onreadystatechang event listen will be automat invok for each of the follow action that chang the readyst properti of the xmlhttprequest object state chang work like thi after the open method ha been invok successfulli the readyst properti of the xmlhttprequest object should be assign a valu of open after the send method ha been invok and the http respons header have been receiv the readyst properti of the xmlhttprequest object should be assign a valu of header receiv onc the http respons content begin to load the readyst properti of the xmlhttprequest object should be assign a valu of load onc the http respons content ha finish load the readyst properti of the xmlhttprequest object should be assign a valu of done the listen will onli respond to state chang which occur after the listen is defin to detect state and the listen must be defin befor the open method is invok the open method must be invok befor the send method is invok var request new xmlhttprequest request onreadystatechang function var done thi done if thi readyst done alert thi readyst request open get somepag xml true request setrequesthead x request with xmlhttprequest tell server that thi call is made for ajax purpos most librari like jqueri prototyp dojo do thi request send null no data need to be sent along with the request the abort method edit thi method abort the request if the readyst of the xmlhttprequest object ha not yet becom the abort method ensur that the callback handler doe not get invok dure an asynchron request abort some ajax librari us the abort method to cancel potenti duplic or out of order request the http respons edit after a success and complet call to the send method of the xmlhttprequest if the server respons wa well form xml and the content type header sent by the server is understood by the user agent as an internet media type for xml the responsexml properti of the xmlhttprequest object will contain a dom document object anoth properti responsetext will contain the respons of the server in plain text by a conform user agent regardless of whether or not it wa understood as xml cross domain request edit in the earli develop of the world wide web it wa found possibl to breach user secur by the us of javascript to exchang inform from on web site with that from anoth less reput on all modern browser therefor implement a same origin polici that prevent mani such attack such as cross site script xmlhttprequest data is subject to thi secur polici but sometim web develop want to intention circumv it restrict thi is sometim due to the legitim us of subdomain as for exampl make an xmlhttprequest from a page creat by foo exampl com for inform from bar
