look for financi gain state sponsor attack ar now common and well resourc but start with amateur such as marku hess who hack for the kgb as recount by clifford stoll in the cuckoo s egg comput protect countermeasur edit in comput secur a countermeasur is an action devic procedur or techniqu that reduc a threat a vulner or an attack by elimin or prevent it by minim the harm it can caus or by discov

respect firewal ar by far the most common prevent system from a network secur perspect as thei can if properli configur shield access to intern network servic and block certain kind of attack through

a similar function for individu system respons is necessarili defin by the assess secur requir of an individu system and mai cover the rang from simpl upgrad of protect to notif of legal author counter attack and the like in some special case a complet destruct of the compromis system is favor as it mai happen that not all the compromis resourc ar detect todai comput secur compris mainli prevent measur like firewal or an exit procedur a firewal can be defin as a wai of filter network data between a host or a network and anoth network such as the internet and can be implement as softwar run on the machin hook into the network stack or in the case of most unix base oper system such as linux built into the oper system kernel to provid real time filter and block anoth implement is a so call physic firewal which consist of a separ machin filter network traffic firewal ar common amongst machin that ar perman connect to the internet howev rel few organis maintain comput system with effect detect system and fewer still have organis respons mechan in place as result as reuter point out compani for the first time report thei ar lose more through electron theft of data than physic steal of asset the primari obstacl to effect erad of cyber crime could be trace to excess relianc on firewal and other autom detect system yet it is basic evid gather by us packet captur applianc that put crimin behind bar difficulti with respons edit respond forcefulli to attempt secur breach in the manner that on would for attempt physic secur breach is often veri difficult for a varieti of reason identifi attack is difficult as thei ar often in a differ jurisdict to the system thei attempt to breach and oper through proxi temporari anonym dial up account wireless connect and other anonymis procedur which make backtrac difficult and ar often locat in yet anoth jurisdict if thei successfulli breach secur thei ar often abl to delet log to cover their track the sheer number of attempt attack is so larg that organis cannot spend time pursu each attack a typic home user with a perman e g cabl modem connect will be attack at least sever time per dai citat need so more attract target could be presum to see mani more note howev that most of the sheer bulk of these attack ar made by autom vulner scanner and comput worm law enforc offic ar often unfamiliar with inform technolog and so lack the skill and interest in pursu attack there ar also budgetari constraint it ha been argu that the high cost of technolog such as dna test and improv forens mean less monei for other kind of law enforc so the overal rate of crimin not get dealt with goe up as the cost of the technolog increas in addit the identif of attack across a network mai requir log from variou point in the network and in mani countri the releas of these record to law enforc with the except of be voluntarili surrend by a network administr or a system administr requir a search warrant and depend on

defens in depth where the design is such that more than on subsystem need to be violat to compromis the integr of the system and the inform it hold default secur set and design to fail secur rather
