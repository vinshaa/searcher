practic edit java platform edit main articl java softwar platform and java virtual machin java control panel version on design goal of java is portabl which mean that program written for the java platform must run similarli on ani combin of hardwar and oper system with adequ runtim support thi is achiev by compil the java languag code to an intermedi represent call java bytecod instead of directli to architectur specif machin code java bytecod instruct ar analog to machin code but thei ar intend to be execut by a virtual machin vm written specif for the host hardwar end user commonli us a java runtim environ jre instal on their own machin for standalon java applic or in a web browser for java applet standard librari provid a gener wai to access host specif featur such as graphic thread and network a major benefit of us bytecod is port howev the overhead of interpret mean that interpret program almost alwai run more slowli than program compil to nativ execut would just in time jit compil were introduc from an earli stage that compil bytecod to machin code dure runtim java is platform independ but as the java virtual machin must convert java bytecod into machin languag which depend on the oper system be us it is platform depend implement edit see also free java implement oracl corpor is the current owner of the offici implement of the java se platform follow their acquisit of sun microsystem on januari thi implement is base on the origin implement of java by sun the oracl implement is avail for microsoft window mac os x linux and solari becaus java lack ani formal standard recogn by ecma intern iso iec ansi or other third parti standard organ the oracl implement is the de facto standard the oracl implement is packag into two differ distribut the java runtim environ jre which contain the part of the java se platform requir to run java program and is intend for end user and the java develop kit jdk which is intend for softwar develop and includ develop tool such as the java compil javadoc jar and a debugg openjdk is anoth notabl java se implement that is licens under the gnu gpl the implement start when sun began releas the java sourc code under the gpl as of java se openjdk is the offici java refer implement the goal of java is to make all implement of java compat histor sun s trademark licens for usag of the java brand insist that all implement be compat thi result in a legal disput with microsoft after sun claim that the microsoft implement did not support rmi or jni and had ad platform specif featur of their own sun su in and in won a settlement of us million as well as a court order enforc the term of the licens from sun as a result microsoft no longer ship java with window platform independ java is essenti to java ee and an even more rigor valid is requir to certifi an implement thi environ enabl portabl server side applic perform edit main articl java perform program written in java have a reput for be slower and requir more memori than those written in c howev java program execut speed improv significantli with the introduct of just in time compil in for java the addit of languag featur support better code analysi such as inner class the stringbuild class option assert etc and optim in the java virtual machin such as hotspot becom the default for sun s jvm in some platform offer direct hardwar support for java there ar microcontrol that can run java in hardwar instead of a softwar java virtual machin and arm base processor can have hardwar support for execut java bytecod through their jazel option automat memori manag edit java us an automat garbag collector to manag memori in the object lifecycl the programm determin when object ar creat and the java runtim is respons for recov the memori onc object ar no longer in us onc no refer to an object remain the unreach memori becom elig to be freed automat by the garbag collector someth similar to a memori leak mai still occur if a programm s code hold a refer to an object that is no longer need typic when object that ar no longer need ar store in contain that ar still in us if method for a nonexist object ar call a null pointer except is thrown on of the idea behind java s automat memori manag model is that programm can be spare the burden of have to perform manual memori manag in some languag memori for the creation of object is implicitli alloc on the stack or explicitli alloc and dealloc from the heap in the latter case the respons of manag memori resid with the programm if the program doe not dealloc an object a memori leak occur if the program attempt to access or dealloc memori that ha alreadi been dealloc the result is undefin and difficult to predict and the program is like to becom unstabl and or crash thi can be partial remedi by the us of smart pointer but these add overhead and complex note that garbag collect doe not prevent logic memori leak i e those where the memori is still referenc but never us garbag collect mai happen at ani time ideal it will occur when a program is idl it is guarante to be trigger if there is insuffici free memori on the heap to alloc a new object thi can caus a program to stall momentarili explicit memori manag is not possibl in java java doe not support c c style pointer arithmet where object address and unsign integ usual long integ can be us interchang thi allow the garbag collector to reloc referenc object and ensur type safeti and secur as in c and some other object orient languag variabl of java s primit data type ar not object valu of primit type ar either store directli in field for object or on the stack for method rather than on the heap as is commonli true for object but see escap analysi thi wa a consciou decis by java s design for perform reason becaus of thi java wa not consid to be a pure object orient program languag howev as of java autobox enabl programm to proce as if primit type were instanc of their wrapper class java contain multipl type of garbag collector by default citat need hotspot us the parallel scaveng garbag collector howev there ar also sever other garbag collector that can be us to manag the heap for of applic in java the concurr mark sweep garbag collector is suffici oracl aim to replac cm with the garbag first collector g syntax edit main articl java syntax the syntax of java is larg deriv from c unlik c which combin the syntax for structur gener and object orient program java wa built almost exclus as an object orient languag all code is written insid class and everi data item is an object with the except of the primit data type i e integ float point number boolean valu and charact which ar not object for perform reason unlik c java doe not support oper overload or multipl inherit for class though multipl inherit is support for interfac thi simplifi the languag and aid in prevent potenti error and anti pattern design java us comment similar to those of c there ar three differ style of comment a
