set that provid access to the dom model of modern javascript capabl web browser the ajax librari and the widget set librari ar a hybrid mix of python and javascript just as with gwt pyjama is not it librari and neither is it yet anoth ajax framework ajax framework ar strictli limit to provid pre prepar specif function written almost exclus in tailor made javascript both gwt and pyjama be javascript compil allow the develop to work in the languag with which thei ar familiar java or python respect to write their own custom widget either entir from scratch or base on the exist avail widget yet still target the full rang of modern browser so far from present web develop with a fait accompli ajax framework pyjama give you the freedom to develop your own design edit the pyjama compil is written in python and us the python program languag to compil it input into javascript walk the abstract syntax tree of the program be compil although the compil is stand alon the primari us of pyjama is for web develop so there is addit infrastructur for build web applic the dom py model librari is an abstract layer a thin layer of python on top of javascript code snippet us of which provid access to the full document object model of the target browser platform as with ani compil the javascript snippet ar treat as inlin assembl furthermor on top of the dom py model librari is an addit abstract layer ui py which provid the most us layer to web develop a full suit of widget with which desktop applic develop will be familiar at present the list of avail widget is a mixtur of the complet set of widget that were avail in googl web toolkit along with a few more that have been forward port from gwt compon edit the major pyjama compon includ pyj python to javascript compilertransl the python program languag to the javascript program languag python builtin and standard emul libraryjavascript implement of the commonli us modul builtin and class in the python standard runtim

modul a modul for creat widget as if the web browser wa a desktop widget engin pyjama desktop portssupport for run pyjama app as pure python under mshtml xulrunn or webkit pyjama desktop is conceptu close to gwt host mode except that the applic can be deploi live under pyjama desktop rather than be us exclus as a debug tool pyjama desktop edit the widget set librari that come with pyjama is so similar to pyqt and pygtk that a port of pyjama wa made to run pyjama applic on the desktop call pyjamasdesktop or pyj desktop as of mai the project us webkit xulrunn or mshtml as the underli technolog and it is through these browser engin that pyjama manipul the dom model of the applic pyjama and pyjama desktop allow write cross platform cross desktop cross browser and cross widget applic that run on the web and on the desktop histori edit thi section is written like a person reflect or opinion essai that state the wikipedia editor s particular feel about a topic rather than the opinion of expert pleas help improv it by rewrit it in an encycloped style februari pyjama wa origin develop by jame tauber the origin code for the ui widget set and the dom support librari came from googl web toolkit and wa port by jame tauber jame wrote the origin pyj compil luke leighton took over the project in and updat the ui widget set improv the compil and creat the three pyj desktop runtim bernd dorn and hi colleagu from love system did some dramat compil improv for kee bo join becaus he wa not interest in learn javascript but learn he definit did kee is respons for the major of the vast improv and the more esoter python interoper in the compil such as yield long data type and much much more c anthoni rising also join as lead and administr of the project on mai the leadership role of the project came into question thi wa a commun driven open sourc project that wa extens develop by mani contributor includ the peopl mention abov due to disagr between member of the group on how to move forward with the infrastructur and direct of the softwar some member decid to creat their own fork of the pyjama project thi fork wa creat by a team led by anthoni rising on of the administr of the project thi group includ the person who own the pyj org domain and he voluntarili decid to assign ownership of the domain to thi new fork be creat and henc becam the new pyj org fork of the pyjama project luke leighton continu hi work on hi own fork through a new domain pyj be and continu to develop and maintain pyjama on thi pyj be fork thi still left a controversi over the copi of the mail list data from the old server to creat the new mail list of googl group thi wa rais as a violat of the uk data protect act by luke leighton whether thi wa actual a legal violat is not realli clear and is open to interpret thi wa a commun driven open sourc project accord to mani in the commun weasel word both luke and anthoni were co administr of the project and co lead to it it wa be fork by a team includ anthoni on of the administr who had privileg for the server which luke leighton own the mail list wa part of the domain so the ownership of the mail list data itself isn t veri clear though luke claim he person own the mail list and that us it to creat a new mail list for the new pyj org fork of the project constitut steal mani in the commun weasel word feel differ mani feel weasel word that thi wa an open sourc commun project and luke leighton wa a co lead and co administr henc the mail list wa actual a commun properti of the pyj org commun and not the person properti of luke thu though some disagre in the opinion of mani in the commun weasel word us it to creat the new googl group wa legal even though the ownership of the mail list data is not entir clear when some member complain about be subscrib to the new googl group mail list immedi action wa taken by the maintain of the new pyj org fork to remov everyon from the new googl group and invit all the member to voluntarili join the new googl group thi be exactli the same approach that luke leighton took when he decid to move the pyjama mail list from googl group where it wa origin creat befor luke leighton took over leadership of the project the current membership of the googl group own and maintain by both fork of the origin pyj org is now voluntari creat through invit and doe not violat ani privaci and data protect law there ar no unresolv legal issu at thi time nor ani pend lawsuit with either fork of the pyjama project both fork ar be activ develop and have form their own commun follow
