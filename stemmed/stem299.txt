for each frequenc compon of m at fi there ar two sideband at frequenc fc fi and fc fi the collect of the former frequenc abov the carrier frequenc is known as the upper sideband and those below constitut the lower sideband in a slightli differ wai of look at it we can consid the modul m t to consist of an equal mix of posit and neg frequenc compon as result from a formal fourier transform of
