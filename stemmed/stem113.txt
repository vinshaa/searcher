and remov june troubleshoot is a form of problem solv often appli to repair fail product or process it is a logic systemat search for the sourc of a problem so that it can be solv and so the product or process can be made oper again troubleshoot is need to develop and maintain complex system where the symptom of a problem can have mani possibl caus troubleshoot is us in mani field such as engin system administr electron automot repair and diagnost medicin troubleshoot requir identif of the malfunct s or symptom within a system then experi is commonli us to gener possibl caus of the symptom determin the most like caus is a process of elimin elimin potenti caus of a problem final troubleshoot requir confirm that the solut restor the product or process to it work state in gener troubleshoot is the identif of diagnosi of troubl in the manag flow of a corpor or a system caus by a failur of some kind the problem is initi describ as symptom of malfunct and troubleshoot is the process of determin and remedi the caus of these symptom a system can be describ in term of it expect desir or intend behavior usual for artifici system it purpos event or input to the system ar expect to gener specif result or output for exampl select the print option from variou comput applic is intend to result in a hardcopi emerg from some specif devic ani unexpect or undesir behavior is a symptom troubleshoot is the process of isol the specif caus or caus of the symptom frequent the symptom is a failur of the product or process to produc ani result noth wa print for exampl correct action can then be taken to prevent further failur of a similar kind the method of forens engin ar especi us in trace problem in product or process and a wide rang of analyt techniqu ar avail to determin the caus or caus of specif failur correct action can then be taken to prevent further failur of a similar kind prevent action is possibl us failur mode and effect fmea and fault tree analysi fta befor full scale product and these method can also be us for failur analysi content aspect half split reproduc symptom intermitt symptom multipl problem see also refer aspect edit even most discuss of troubleshoot and especi train in formal troubleshoot procedur tend to be domain specif even though the basic principl ar univers applic usual troubleshoot is appli to someth that ha suddenli stop work sinc it previous work state form the expect about it continu behavior so the initi focu is often on recent chang to the system or to the environ in which it exist for exampl a printer that wa work when it wa plug in over there howev there is a well known principl that correl doe not impli causal for exampl the failur of a devic shortli after it s been plug into a differ outlet doesn t necessarili mean that the event were relat the failur could have been a matter of coincid therefor troubleshoot demand critic think rather than magic think it s us to consid the common experi we have with light bulb light bulb burn out more or less at random eventu the repeat heat and cool of it filament and fluctuat in the power suppli to it caus the filament to crack or vapor the same principl appli to most other electron devic and similar principl appli to mechan devic some failur ar part of the normal wear and tear of compon in a system a basic principl in troubleshoot is to start from the simplest and most probabl possibl problem first thi is illustr by the old sai when you see hoof print look for hors not zebra or to us anoth maxim us the kiss principl thi principl result in the common complaint about help desk or manual that thei sometim first ask is it plug in and doe that receptacl have power but thi should not be taken as an affront rather it should serv as a remind or condit to alwai check the simpl thing first befor call for help a troubleshoot could check each compon in a system on by on substitut known good compon for each potenti suspect on howev thi process of serial substitut can be consid degener when compon ar substitut without regard to a hypothesi concern how their failur could result in the symptom be diagnos simpl and intermedi system ar character by list or tree of depend among their compon or subsystem more complex system contain cyclic depend or interact feedback loop such system ar less amen to bisect troubleshoot techniqu it also help to start from a known good state the best exampl be a comput reboot a cognit walkthrough is also a good thing to try comprehens document produc by profici technic writer is veri help especi if it provid a theori of oper for the subject devic or system a common caus of problem is bad design for exampl bad human factor design where a devic could be insert backward or upsid down due to the lack of an appropri forc function behavior shape constraint or a lack of error toler design thi is especi bad if accompani by habitu where the user just doesn t notic the incorrect usag for instanc if two part have differ function but share a common case so that it isn t appar on a casual inspect which part is be us troubleshoot can also take the form of a systemat checklist troubleshoot procedur flowchart or tabl that is made befor a problem occur develop troubleshoot procedur in advanc allow suffici thought about the step to take in troubleshoot and organ the troubleshoot into the most effici troubleshoot process troubleshoot tabl can be computer to make them more effici for user some computer troubleshoot servic such as primefax later renam maxserv immedi show the top solut with the highest probabl of fix the underli problem the technician can either answer addit question to advanc through the troubleshoot procedur each step narrow the list of solut or immedi implement the solut he feel will fix the problem these servic give a rebat if the technician take an addit step after the problem is solv report back the solut that actual fix the problem the comput us these report to updat it estim of which solut have the highest probabl of fix that particular set of symptom half split edit effici method troubleshoot start with a clear understand of the expect behavior of the system and the symptom be observ from there the troubleshoot form hypothes on potenti caus and devis or perhap refer a standard checklist of test to elimin these prospect caus thi approach is often call divid and conquer two common strategi us by troubleshoot ar to check for frequent encount or easili test condit first for exampl check to ensur that a printer s light is on and that it cabl is firmli seat at both end thi is often refer to as milk the front panel then bisect the system for exampl in a network print system check to see if the job reach the server to determin whether a problem exist in the subsystem toward the user s end or toward the devic thi latter techniqu can be particularli effici in system with long chain of serial depend or interact among it compon it s simpli the applic of a binari search across the rang of depend and is often refer to as half split reproduc symptom edit on of the core principl of troubleshoot is that reproduc problem can be reliabl isol and resolv often consider effort and emphasi in troubleshoot is place on reproduc on find a procedur to reliabl induc the symptom to occur intermitt symptom edit some of the most difficult troubleshoot issu relat to symptom which occur intermitt in electron thi often is the result of compon that ar thermal sensit sinc resist of a circuit vari with the temperatur of the conductor in it compress air can be us to cool specif spot on a circuit board and a heat gun can be us to rais the temperatur thu troubleshoot of electron system frequent entail appli these tool in order to reproduc a problem in comput program race condit often lead to intermitt symptom which ar extrem difficult to reproduc variou techniqu can be us to forc the particular function or modul to be call more rapidli than it would be in normal oper analog to heat up a compon in a hardwar circuit while other techniqu can be us to introduc greater delai in or forc synchron among other modul or interact process intermitt issu can be thu defin an intermitt is a problem for which there is no known procedur to consist reproduc it symptom steven litt in particular he assert that there is a distinct between frequenc of occurr and a known procedur to consist reproduc an issu for exampl know that an intermitt problem occur within an hour of a particular stimulu or event but that sometim it happen in five minut and other time it take almost an hour doe not constitut a known procedur even if the stimulu doe increas the frequenc of observ exhibit of the symptom nevertheless sometim troubleshoot must resort to statist method and can onli find procedur to increas the symptom s occurr to a point at which serial substitut or some other techniqu is feasibl in such case even when the symptom seem to disappear for significantli longer period there is a low confid that the root caus ha been found and that the problem is truli solv also test mai be run to stress certain compon to determin if those compon have fail multipl problem edit isol singl compon failur which caus reproduc symptom is rel straightforward howev mani problem onli occur as a result of multipl failur or error thi is particularli true of fault toler system or those with built in redund featur which add redund fault detect and failov to a system mai also be subject to failur and enough differ compon failur in ani system will take it down even in simpl system the troubleshoot must alwai consid the possibl that there is more than on fault replac each compon us serial substitut and then swap each new compon back out for the old on when the symptom is found to persist can fail to resolv such case more importantli the replac of ani compon with a defect on can actual increas the number of problem rather than elimin them note that while we talk about replac compon the resolut of mani problem involv adjust or tune rather than replac for exampl intermitt break in conductor or dirti or loos contact might simpli need to be clean and or tighten all discuss of replac should be taken to mean replac or adjust or other mainten see also edit whysbathtub curvecaus and effectdebuggingforens engineeringno troubl foundproblem
