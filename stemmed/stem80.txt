url into a local file system resourc for static request an intern or extern program name for dynam request for a static request the url path specifi by the client is rel to the web server s root directori consid the follow url as it would be request by a client http www exampl com path file html the client s user agent will translat it into a connect to www exampl com with the follow http request get path file html http host www exampl com the web server on www exampl com will append the given path to the path of it root directori on an apach server thi is commonli home www on unix machin usual var www the result is the local file system resourc home www path file html the web server then read the file if it exist and send a respons to the client s web browser the respons will describ the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error messag will return sai that the file doe not exist or is unavail kernel mode and user mode web server edit a web server can be either incorpor into the os kernel or in user space like other regular applic web server that run in user mode have to ask the system for permiss to us more memori or more cpu resourc not onli do these request to the kernel take time but thei ar not alwai satisfi becaus the system reserv resourc for it own usag and ha the respons to share hardwar resourc with all the other run applic execut in user mode can also mean useless buffer copi which ar anoth handicap for user mode web server load limit edit a web server program ha defin load limit becaus it can handl onli a limit number of concurr client connect usual between and by default between and per ip address and tcp port and it can serv onli a certain maximum number of request per second depend on it own set the http request type whether the content is static or dynam whether the content is cach andth hardwar and softwar limit of the os of the comput on which the web server run when a web server is near to or over it limit it becom unrespons caus of overload edit at ani time web server can be overload due to excess legitim web traffic thousand or even million of client connect to the web site in a short interv e g slashdot

comput worm that sometim caus abnorm traffic becaus of million of infect comput not coordin among them xss virus can caus high traffic becaus of million of infect browser and or web server internet bot traffic not filter limit on larg web site with veri few resourc bandwidth etc internet network slowdown so that client request ar serv more slowli and the number of connect increas so much that server limit ar reach web server comput partial unavail thi can happen becaus of requir or urgent mainten or upgrad hardwar or softwar failur back end e g databas failur etc in these case the remain web server get too much traffic and becom overload symptom of overload edit the symptom of an overload web server ar request ar serv with possibl long delai from second to a few hundr second the web server return an http error code such as or even which is inappropri for an overload condit the web server refus or reset interrupt tcp connect befor it return ani content in veri rare case the web
