amateur astronom with small telescop ar more effect than the rel small number of larg telescop that ar avail to profession astronom sever organ such as the american associ of variabl star observ exist to help coordin these contribut amateur astronom often contribut toward activ such as monitor the chang in bright of variabl star and supernova help to track asteroid and observ occult to determin both the shape of asteroid and the shape of the terrain on the appar edg of the moon as seen from earth with more advanc equip but still cheap in comparison to profession setup amateur astronom can measur the light spectrum emit from astronom object which can yield high qualiti scientif data if the measur ar perform with due care a rel recent role for amateur astronom is search for overlook
