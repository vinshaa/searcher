commun protocol from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirect from protocol comput jump to navig search for other us see protocol disambigu it ha been suggest that internetwork protocol be merg into thi articl discuss propos sinc januari in telecommun a commun protocol is a system of rule that allow two or more entiti of a commun system to commun between them to transmit inform via ani kind of variat of a physic quantiti these ar the rule or standard that defin the syntax semant and synchron of commun and possibl error recoveri method protocol mai be implement by hardwar softwar or a combin of both commun system us well defin format protocol for exchang messag each messag ha an exact mean intend to elicit a respons from a rang of possibl respons pre determin for that particular situat the specifi behavior is typic independ of how it is to be implement commun protocol have to be agre upon by the parti involv to reach agreement a protocol mai be develop into a technic standard a program languag describ the same for comput so there is a close analog between protocol and program languag protocol ar to commun as program languag ar to comput content commun system basic requir of protocol formal specif protocol and program languag univers protocol protocol design a basi for protocol design layer protocol layer softwar layer strict layer protocol develop the need for protocol standard standard organ the standard process futur of standard osi taxonomi exampl of protocol note refer see also extern link commun system edit the inform exchang between devic through a network or other media is govern by rule and convent that can be set out in technic specif call commun protocol standard the natur of a commun the actual data exchang and ani state depend behavior is defin by it specif in digit comput system the rule can be express by algorithm and data structur express the algorithm in a portabl program languag make the protocol softwar oper system independ oper system usual contain of a set of cooper process that manipul share data to commun with each other thi commun is govern by well understood protocol which can be embed in the process code itself in contrast becaus there is no common memori commun system have to commun with each other us a share transmiss medium transmiss is not necessarili reliabl and individu system mai us differ hardwar and or oper system to implement a network protocol the protocol softwar modul ar interfac with a framework implement on the machin s oper system thi framework implement the network function of the oper system the best known framework ar the tcp ip model and the osi model at the time the internet wa develop layer had proven to be a success design approach for both compil and oper system design and given the similar between program languag and commun protocol layer wa appli to the protocol as well thi gave rise to the concept of layer protocol which nowadai form the basi of protocol design system typic do not us a singl protocol to handl a transmiss instead thei us a set of cooper protocol sometim call a protocol famili or protocol suit some of the best known protocol suit includ ipx spx x ax appletalk and tcp ip the protocol can be arrang base on function in group for instanc there is a group of transport protocol the function ar map onto the layer each layer solv a distinct class of problem relat to for instanc applic transport internet and network interfac function to transmit a messag a protocol ha to be select from each layer so some sort of multiplex demultiplex take place the select of the next protocol is accomplish by extend the messag with a protocol selector for each layer basic requir of protocol edit messag ar sent and receiv on commun system to establish commun protocol should therefor specifi rule govern the transmiss in gener much of the follow should be address data format for data exchang digit messag bitstr ar exchang the bitstr ar divid in field and each field carri inform relev to the protocol conceptu the bitstr is divid into two part call the header area and the data area the actual messag is store in the data area so the header area contain the field with more relev to the protocol bitstr longer than the maximum transmiss unit mtu ar divid in piec of appropri size address format for data exchang address ar us to identifi both the sender and the intend receiv s the address ar store in the header area of the bitstr allow the receiv to determin whether the bitstr ar intend for themselv and should be process or should be ignor a connect between a sender and a receiv can be identifi us an address pair sender address receiv address usual some address valu have special mean an all s address could be taken to mean an address of all station on the network so send to thi address would result in a broadcast on the local network the rule describ the mean of the address valu ar collect call an address scheme address map sometim protocol need to map address of on scheme on address of anoth scheme for instanc to translat a logic ip address specifi by the applic to an ethernet hardwar address thi is refer to as address map rout when system ar not directli connect intermediari system along the rout to the intend receiv s need to forward messag on behalf of the sender on the internet the network ar connect us router thi wai of connect network is call internetwork detect of transmiss error is necessari on network which cannot guarante error free oper in a common approach crc of the data area ar ad to the end of packet make it possibl for the receiv to detect differ caus by error the receiv reject the packet on crc differ and arrang somehow for retransmiss acknowledg of correct recept of packet is requir for connect orient commun acknowledg ar sent from receiv back to their respect sender loss of inform timeout and retri packet mai be lost on the network or suffer from long delai to cope with thi under some protocol a sender mai expect an acknowledg of correct recept from the receiv within a certain amount of time on timeout the sender must assum the packet wa not receiv and retransmit it in case of a perman broken link the retransmiss ha no effect so the number of retransmiss is limit exceed the retri limit is consid an error direct of inform flow need to be address if transmiss can onli occur in on direct at a time as on half duplex link thi is known as media access control arrang have to be made to accommod the case when two parti want to gain control at the same time sequenc control we have seen that long bitstr ar divid in piec and then sent on the network individu the piec mai get lost or delai or take differ rout to their destin on some type of network as a result piec mai arriv out of sequenc retransmiss can result in duplic piec by mark the piec with sequenc inform at the sender the receiv can determin what wa lost or duplic ask for necessari retransmiss and reassembl the origin messag flow control is need when the sender transmit faster than the receiv or intermedi network equip can process the transmiss flow control can be implement by messag from receiv to sender get the data across a network is onli part of the problem for a protocol the data receiv ha to be evalu in the context of the progress of the convers so a protocol ha to specifi rule describ the context these kind of rule ar said to express the syntax of the commun other rule determin whether the data is meaning for the context in which the exchang take place these kind of rule ar said to express the semant of the commun formal specif edit formal wai for describ the syntax of the commun ar abstract syntax notat on an iso standard or augment backu naur form an ietf standard finit state machin model and commun finit state machin ar us to formal describ the possibl interact of the protocol protocol and program languag edit protocol ar to commun what algorithm or program languag ar to comput thi analog ha import consequ for both the design and the develop of protocol on ha to consid the fact that algorithm program and protocol ar just differ wai of describ expect behavior of interact object a familiar exampl of a protocol languag is the html languag us to describ web page which ar the actual web protocol in program languag the associ of identifi to a valu is term a definit program text is structur us block construct and definit can be local to a block the local associ of an identifi to a valu establish by a definit is term a bind and the region of program text in which a bind is effect is known as it scope the comput state is kept us two compon the environ us as a record of identifi bind and the store which is us as a record of the effect of assign in commun messag valu ar transfer us transmiss media by analog the equival of a store would be a collect of transmiss media instead of a collect of memori locat a valid assign in a protocol as an analog of program languag could be ethernet messag mean a messag is to be broadcast on the local ethernet on a transmiss medium there can be mani receiv for instanc a mac address identifi an ether network card on the transmiss medium the ether in our imaginari protocol the assign ethernet mac address messag valu could therefor make sens by extend the assign statement of an exist program languag with the semant describ a protocol languag could easili be imagin oper system provid reliabl commun and synchron facil for commun object confin to the same system by mean of system librari a programm us a gener purpos program languag like c or ada can us the routin in the librari to implement a protocol instead of us a dedic protocol languag univers protocol edit the nice thing about standard is that you have so mani to choos from andrew s tanenbaum in comput network despit their number network protocol show littl varieti becaus all network protocol us the same underli principl and concept in the same wai so the us of a gener purpos program languag would yield a larg number of applic onli differ in the detail a suitabl defin dedic protocol languag would therefor have littl syntax perhap just enough to specifi some paramet or option mode of oper becaus it virtual machin would have incorpor all possibl principl and concept make the virtual machin itself a univers protocol the protocol languag would have some syntax and a lot of semant describ thi univers protocol and would therefor in effect be a protocol hardli differ from thi univers network protocol in thi network context a protocol is a languag the notion of a univers network protocol provid a rational for standard of network protocol assum the exist of a univers network protocol develop of protocol standard us a consensu model the agreement of a group of expert might be a viabl wai to coordin protocol design effort network protocol oper in veri heterogen environ consist of veri differ network technolog and a possibl veri rich set of applic so a singl univers protocol would be veri hard to design and implement correctli instead the ietf decid to reduc complex by assum a rel simpl network architectur allow decomposit of the singl univers network protocol into two gener protocol tcp and ip and two class of specif protocol on deal with the low level network detail and on deal with the high level detail of common network applic remot login file transfer email and web brows iso choos a similar but more gener path allow other network architectur to standard protocol protocol design edit commun system oper in parallel the program tool and techniqu for deal with parallel process ar collect call concurr program concurr program onli deal with the synchron of commun the syntax and semant of the commun govern by a low level protocol usual have modest complex so thei can be code with rel eas high level protocol with rel larg complex could howev merit the implement of languag interpret an exampl of the latter case is the html languag concurr program ha tradition been a topic in oper system theori text formal verif seem indispens becaus concurr program ar notori for the hidden and sophist bug thei contain a mathemat approach to the studi of concurr and commun is refer to as commun sequenti process csp concurr can also be model us finit state machin like meali and moor machin meali and moor machin ar in us as design tool in digit electron system which we encount in the form of hardwar us in telecommun or electron devic in gener thi kind of design can be a bit of a challeng to sai the least so it is import to keep thing simpl for the internet protocol in particular and in retrospect thi meant a basi for protocol design wa need to allow decomposit of protocol into much simpler cooper protocol a basi for protocol design edit system do not us a singl protocol to handl a transmiss instead thei us a set of cooper protocol sometim call a protocol famili or protocol suit to cooper the protocol have to commun with each other so some kind of conceptu framework is need to make thi commun possibl also note that softwar is need to implement both the xfer mechan and a protocol no protocol no commun in literatur there ar numer refer to the analog between comput commun and program by analog we could sai that the aforement xfer mechan is compar to a cpu a xfer mechan perform commun and a cpu perform comput and the framework introduc someth that allow the protocol to be design independ of on anoth by provid separ execut environ for them furthermor it is repeatedli state that protocol ar to comput commun what program languag ar to comput layer edit figur the tcp ip model or internet layer scheme and it relat to some common protocol the commun protocol in us on the internet ar design to function in veri divers and complex set to eas design commun protocol ar structur us a layer scheme as a basi instead of us a singl univers protocol to handl all transmiss task a set of cooper protocol fit the layer scheme is us the layer scheme in us on the internet is call the tcp ip model the actual protocol ar collect call the internet protocol suit the group respons for thi design is call the internet engin task forc ietf typic a hardwar deliveri mechan layer is us to build a connectionless packet deliveri system on top of which a reliabl transport layer is built on top of which is the applic softwar layer below and abov these can be defin and protocol ar veri often stack to give tunnel for exampl the internet protocol can be tunnel across an atm network protocol to provid connect by layer the internet protocol on top of the atm protocol transport layer the number of layer of a layer scheme and the wai the layer ar defin can have a drastic impact on the protocol involv thi is where the analog come into plai for the tcp ip model becaus the design of tcp ip emploi the same techniqu us to conquer the complex of program languag compil design by analog in the implement of it protocol and it layer scheme protocol layer edit figur messag flow us a protocol suit black loop show the actual messag loop red loop ar the effect commun between layer enabl by the lower layer protocol layer now form the basi of protocol design it allow the decomposit of singl complex protocol into simpler cooper protocol but it is also a function decomposit becaus each protocol belong to a function class call a protocol layer the protocol layer each solv a distinct class of commun problem the internet protocol suit consist of the follow layer applic transport internet and network interfac function togeth the layer make up a layer scheme or model in comput we have algorithm and data and in commun we have protocol and messag so the analog of a data flow diagram would be some kind of messag flow diagram to visual protocol layer and protocol suit a diagram of the messag flow in and between two system a and b is shown in figur the system both make us of the same protocol suit the vertic flow and protocol ar in system and the horizont messag flow and protocol ar between system the messag flow ar govern by rule and data format specifi by protocol the blue line therefor mark the boundari of the horizont protocol layer the vertic protocol ar not layer becaus thei don t obei the protocol layer principl which state that a layer protocol is design so that layer n at the destin receiv exactli the same object sent by layer n at the sourc the horizont protocol ar layer protocol and all belong to the protocol suit layer protocol allow the protocol design to concentr on on layer at a time without worri about how other layer perform the vertic protocol need not be the same protocol on both system but thei have to satisfi some minim assumpt to ensur the protocol layer principl hold for the layer protocol thi can be achiev us a techniqu call encapsul usual a messag or a stream of data is divid into small piec call messag or stream packet ip datagram or network frame depend on the layer in which the piec ar to be transmit the piec contain a header area and a data area the data in the header area identifi the sourc and the destin on the network of the packet the protocol and other data meaning to the protocol like crc s of the data to be sent data length and a timestamp the rule enforc by the vertic protocol is that the piec for transmiss ar to be encapsul in the data area of all lower protocol on the send side and the revers is to happen on the receiv side the result is that at the lowest level the piec look like thi header header header data and in the layer directli abov it header header data and in the top layer header data both on the send and receiv side thi rule therefor ensur that the protocol layer principl hold and effect virtual all but the lowest transmiss line so for thi reason some messag flow ar colour red in figur to ensur both side us the same protocol the piec also carri data identifi the protocol in their header the design of the protocol layer and the network or internet architectur ar interrel so on cannot be design without the other some of the more import featur in thi respect of the internet architectur and the network servic it provid ar describ next the internet offer univers interconnect which mean that ani pair of comput connect to the internet is allow to commun each comput is identifi by an address on the internet all the interconnect physic network appear to the user as a singl larg network thi interconnect scheme is call an internetwork or internet conceptu an internet address consist of a netid and a hostid the netid identifi a network and the hostid identifi a host the term host is mislead in that an individu comput can have multipl network interfac each have it own internet address an internet address identifi a connect to the network not an individu comput the netid is us by router to decid where to send a packet network technolog independ is achiev us the low level address resolut protocol arp which is us to map internet address to physic address the map is call address resolut thi wai physic address ar onli us by the protocol of the network interfac layer the tcp ip protocol can make us of almost ani underli commun technolog figur messag flow in the presenc of a router physic network ar interconnect by router router forward packet between interconnect network make it possibl for host to reach host on other physic network the messag flow between two commun system a and b in the presenc of a router r ar illustr in figur datagram ar pass from router to router until a router is reach that can deliv the datagram on a physic attach network call direct deliveri to decid whether a datagram is to be deliv directli or is to be sent to a router closer to the destin a tabl call the ip rout tabl is consult the tabl consist of pair of networkid and the path to be taken to reach known network the path can be an indic that the datagram should be deliv directli or it can be the address of a router known to be closer to the destin a special entri can specifi that a default router is chosen when there ar no known path all network ar treat equal a lan a wan or a point to point link between two comput ar all consid as on network a connectionless packet deliveri or packet switch system or servic is offer by the internet becaus it adapt well to differ hardwar includ best effort deliveri mechan like the ethernet connectionless deliveri mean that the messag or stream ar divid into piec that ar multiplex separ on the high speed intermachin connect allow the connect to be us concurr each piec carri inform identifi the destin the deliveri of packet is said to be unreli becaus packet mai be lost duplic delai or deliv out of order without notic to the sender or receiv unreli aris onli when resourc ar exhaust or underli network fail the unreli connectionless deliveri system is defin by the internet protocol ip the protocol also specifi the rout function which choos a path over which data will be sent it is also possibl to us tcp ip protocol on connect orient system connect orient system build up virtual circuit path for exclus us between sender and receiv onc built up the ip datagram ar sent as if thei were data through the virtual circuit and forward as data to the ip protocol modul thi techniqu call tunnel can be us on x network and atm network a reliabl stream transport servic us the unreli connectionless packet deliveri servic is defin by the transmiss control protocol tcp the servic ar layer as well and the applic program resid in the layer abov it call the applic servic can make us of tcp program wish to interact with the packet deliveri system itself can do so us the user datagram protocol udp softwar layer edit have establish the protocol layer and the protocol the protocol design can now resum with the softwar design the softwar ha a layer organ and it relationship with protocol layer is visual in figur figur protocol and softwar layer the softwar modul implement the protocol ar repres by cube the inform flow between the modul is repres by arrow the top two horizont red arrow ar virtual the blue line mark the layer boundari to send a messag on system a the top modul interact with the modul directli below it and hand over the messag to be encapsul thi modul react by encapsul the messag in it own data area and fill in it header data in accord with the protocol it implement and interact with the modul below it by hand over thi newli form messag whenev appropri the bottom modul directli interact with the bottom modul of system b so the messag is sent across on the receiv system b the revers happen so ultim and assum there were no transmiss error or protocol violat etc the messag get deliv in it origin form to the topmodul of system b on protocol error a receiv modul discard the piec it ha receiv and report back the error condit to the origin sourc of the piec on the same layer by hand the error messag down or in case of the bottom modul send it across the divis of the messag or stream of data into piec and the subsequ reassembl ar handl in the layer that introduc the divis reassembl the reassembl is done at the destin i e not on ani intermedi router tcp ip softwar is organ in four layer applic layer at the highest layer the servic avail across a tcp ip internet ar access by applic program the applic choos the style of transport to be us which can be a sequenc of individu messag or a continu stream of byte the applic program pass data to the transport layer for deliveri transport layer the transport layer provid commun from on applic to anoth the transport layer mai regul flow of inform and provid reliabl transport ensur that data arriv without error and in sequenc to do so the receiv side send back acknowledg and the send side retransmit lost piec call packet the stream of data is divid into packet by the modul and each packet is pass along with a destin address to the next layer for transmiss the layer must accept data from mani applic concurr and therefor also includ code in the packet header to identifi the send and receiv applic program internet layer the internet layer handl the commun between machin packet to be sent ar accept from the transport layer along with an identif of the receiv machin the packet ar encapsul in ip datagram and the datagram header ar fill a rout algorithm is us to determin if the datagram should be deliv directli or sent to a router the datagram is pass to the appropri network interfac for transmiss incom datagram ar check for valid and the rout algorithm is us to decid whether the datagram should be process local or forward if the datagram is address to the local machin the datagram header is delet and the appropri transport protocol for the packet is chosen icmp error and control messag ar handl as well in thi layer network interfac layer the network interfac layer is respons for accept ip datagram and transmit them over a specif network a network interfac mai consist of a devic driver or a complex subsystem that us it own data link protocol program translat ha been divid into four subproblem compil assembl link editor and loader as a result the translat softwar is layer as well allow the softwar layer to be design independ note that the wai to conquer the complex of program translat could readili be appli to protocol becaus of the analog between program languag and protocol the design of the tcp ip protocol suit were keen on impos the same layer on the softwar framework thi can be seen in the tcp ip layer by consid the translat of a pascal program messag that is compil function of the applic layer into an assembl program that is assembl function of the transport layer to object code piec that is link function of the internet layer togeth with librari object code rout tabl by the link editor produc relocat machin code datagram that is pass to the loader which fill in the memori locat ethernet address to produc execut code network frame to be load function of the network interfac layer into physic memori transmiss medium to show just how close the analog fit the term between parenthes in the previou sentenc denot the relev analog and the term written cursiv denot data represent program translat form a linear sequenc becaus each layer s output is pass as input to the next layer furthermor the translat process involv multipl data represent we see the same thing happen in protocol softwar where multipl protocol defin the data represent of the data pass between the softwar modul the network interfac layer us physic address and all the other layer onli us ip address the boundari between network interfac layer and internet layer is call the high level protocol address boundari the modul below the applic layer ar gener consid part of the oper system pass data between these modul is much less expens than pass data between an applic program and the transport layer the boundari between applic layer and transport layer is call the oper system boundari strict layer edit strictli adher to a layer model a practic known as strict layer is not alwai the best approach to network strict layer can have a seriou impact on the perform of the implement so there is at least a trade off between simplic and perform anoth perhap more import point can be shown by consid the fact that some of the protocol in the internet protocol suit cannot be express us the tcp ip model in other word some of the protocol behav in wai not describ by the model to improv on the model an offend protocol could perhap be split up into two protocol at the cost of on or two extra layer but there is a hidden caveat becaus the model is also us to provid a conceptu view on the suit for the intend user there is a trade off to be made here between precis for the design and clariti for the intend user protocol develop edit for commun to take place protocol have to be agre upon recal that in digit comput system the rule can be express by algorithm and datastructur rais the opportun for hardwar independ express the algorithm in a portabl program languag make the protocol softwar oper system independ the sourc code could be consid a protocol specif thi form of specif howev is not suitabl for the parti involv for on thing thi would enforc a sourc on all parti and for anoth proprietari softwar produc would not accept thi by describ the softwar interfac of the modul on paper and agre on the interfac implement ar free to do it their wai thi is refer to as sourc independ by specifi the algorithm on paper and detail hardwar depend in an unambigu wai a paper draft is creat that when adher to and publish ensur interoper between softwar and hardwar such a paper draft can be develop into a protocol standard by get the approv of a standard organ to get the approv the paper draft need to enter and successfulli complet the standard process thi activ is refer to as protocol develop the member of the standard organ agre to adher to the standard on a voluntari basi often the member ar in control of larg market share relev to the protocol and in mani case standard ar enforc by law or the govern becaus thei ar thought to serv an import public interest so get approv can be veri import for the protocol it should be note though that in some case protocol standard ar not suffici to gain widespread accept i e sometim the sourc code need to be disclos and enforc by law or the govern in the interest of the public the need for protocol standard edit the need for protocol standard can be shown by look at what happen to the bi sync protocol bsc invent by ibm bsc is an earli link level protocol us to connect two separ node it wa origin not intend to be us in a multinod network but do so reveal sever defici of the protocol in the absenc of standard manufactur and organ felt free to enhanc the protocol creat incompat version on their network in some case thi wa deliber done to discourag user from us equip from other manufactur there ar more than variant of the origin bi sync protocol on can assum that a standard would have prevent at least some of thi from happen in some case protocol gain market domin without go through a standard process such protocol ar refer to as de facto standard de facto standard ar common in emerg market nich market or market that ar monopol or oligopol thei can hold a market in a veri neg grip especi when us to scare awai competit from a histor perspect standard should be seen as a measur to counteract the ill effect of de facto standard posit except exist a de facto standard oper system like gnu linux doe not have thi neg grip on it market becaus the sourc ar publish and maintain in an open wai thu invit competit

inconsist and ambigu will inevit be found when implement the standard intern standard ar reissu period to handl the defici and reflect chang view on the subject futur of standard osi edit a lesson learn from arpanet the predecessor of the internet is that standard of protocol is not enough becaus protocol also need a framework to oper it is therefor import to develop a gener purpos futur proof framework suitabl for structur protocol such as layer protocol and their standard thi would prevent protocol standard with overlap function and would allow clear definit of the respons of a protocol
