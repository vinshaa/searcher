allow wikipedia to significantli reduc region and cultur bia found in mani other public and make it veri difficult for ani group to censor and impos bia a larg divers editor base also provid access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwis inaccess or littl document a larg number of editor contribut at ani moment also mean that wikipedia can produc encycloped articl and resourc cover

demograph younger rather than older male rather than femal rich enough to afford a comput rather than poor et cetera and mai therefor show some bia some topic mai not be cover well while other mai be
