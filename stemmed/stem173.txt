concurr comput scienc from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search for a more practic discuss see concurr comput the dine philosoph a classic problem involv concurr and share resourc in comput scienc concurr is a properti of system in which sever comput ar execut simultan and potenti interact with each other the comput mai be execut on multipl core in the same chip preemptiv time share thread on the same processor or execut on physic separ processor a number of mathemat model have been develop for gener concurr comput includ petri net process calculi the parallel random access machin model the actor model and the reo coordin languag content issu theori model logic practic see also refer further read extern link issu edit becaus comput in a concurr system can interact with each other while thei ar execut the number of possibl execut path in the system can be extrem larg and the result outcom can be indetermin concurr us of share resourc can be a sourc of indeterminaci lead to issu such as deadlock and starvat the design of concurr system often entail find reliabl techniqu for coordin their execut data exchang memori alloc and execut schedul to minim respons time and maxim throughput theori edit concurr theori ha been an activ field of research in theoret comput scienc on of the first propos wa carl adam petri s semin work on petri net in the earli s in the year sinc a wide varieti of formal have been develop for model and reason about concurr model edit a number of formal for model and understand concurr system have been develop includ the parallel random access machin the actor modelcomput bridg model such as the bsp modelpetri netsprocess calculi csp model tupl space e g lindascoop simpl concurr object orient program reo coordin languag some of these model of concurr ar primarili intend to support reason and specif while other can be us through the entir develop cycl includ design implement proof test and simul of concurr system some of these ar base on messag pass while other have differ mechan for concurr the prolifer of differ model of concurr ha motiv some research to develop wai to unifi these differ theoret model for exampl lee and sangiovanni vincentelli have demonstr that a so call tag signal model can be us to provid a common framework for defin the denot semant of a varieti of differ model of concurr while nielsen sasson and winskel have demonstr that categori theori can be us to provid a similar unifi understand of differ model the concurr represent theorem in the actor model provid a fairli gener wai to repres concurr system that ar close in the sens that thei do not receiv commun from outsid other concurr system e g process calculi can be model in the actor model us a two phase commit protocol the mathemat

progressionsi s in thi wai s can be mathemat character in term of all it possibl behavior logic edit variou type of tempor logic can be us to help reason about concurr system some of these logic such as linear tempor logic and comput tree logic allow assert to be made about the sequenc of state that a concurr system can pass through other such as action comput tree logic hennessi milner logic and lamport s tempor logic of action build their assert from sequenc of action chang in state the princip applic of these logic is in write specif for concurr system practic edit thi section doe not cite

concurr system concurr program is usual consid to be more gener than parallel program becaus it can involv arbitrari and dynam pattern of commun and interact wherea parallel system gener have a predefin and well structur commun pattern the base goal of concurr program includ correct perform and robust concurr system such as oper system and databas manag system ar gener design to oper indefinit includ automat recoveri from failur and not termin unexpectedli see concurr control some concurr system implement a form of transpar concurr in which concurr comput entiti mai compet for and share a singl resourc but the complex of thi competit and share ar shield from the programm becaus thei us share resourc concurr system in gener requir the inclus of some kind of arbit somewher in their implement often in the underli hardwar to control access to those resourc the us of arbit introduc the possibl of indeterminaci in concurr comput which ha major implic for practic includ correct
