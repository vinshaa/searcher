design for develop of veri larg softwar system ada packag can be compil separ ada packag specif the packag interfac can also be compil separ without the implement to check for consist thi make it possibl to detect problem earli dure the design phase befor implement start a larg number of compil time check ar support to help avoid bug that would not be detect until run time in some other languag or would requir explicit check to be ad to the sourc code for exampl the syntax requir explicitli name close of block to prevent error due to mismatch end token the adher to strong type allow detect of mani common softwar error wrong paramet rang violat invalid refer mismatch type etc either dure compil time or otherwis dure run time as concurr is part of the languag specif the compil can

time check to protect against access to unalloc memori buffer overflow error rang violat off by on error arrai access error and other detect bug these check can be disabl in the interest of runtim effici but can often be compil effici it also includ facil to help program verif for these reason ada is wide us in critic system where ani anomali might lead to veri seriou consequ e g accident death injuri or sever financi loss exampl of system where ada is us includ avion atc railwai bank militari and space technolog ada s dynam memori manag is high level and type safe ada doe not have gener or

that handl the low level detail of memori manag the programm can either us the default storag pool or defin new on thi is particularli relev for non uniform memori access it is even possibl to declar sever differ access type that all design the same type but us differ storag pool also the languag provid for access check both at compil time and at run time that ensur that an access valu cannot outliv the type of the object it point to though the semant of the languag allow automat garbag collect of inaccess object most implement do not support it by default as it would caus unpredict

also destroi all the object in the pool ada wa design to resembl the english languag in it syntax for comment a doubl dash resembl an em dash denot comment text comment stop at end of line so there is no danger of unclos comment accident void whole section of sourc code prefix each line or column with will skip all that code while be clearli denot as a column of repeat down the page there is no

instead of condit variabl for signal similar to condit critic region protect object combin the data encapsul and safe mutual exclus from monitor and entri guard from condit critic region the main advantag over classic monitor is that condit variabl ar not requir for signal avoid potenti deadlock due to incorrect lock semant like task the protect object is a built in limit type and it also ha a declar part and a bodi a protect object consist of encapsul privat data which can onli be access from within the protect object and procedur function and entri which ar guarante to be mutual exclus
