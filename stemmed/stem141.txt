with lead sigil which allow variabl to be interpol directli into string howev unlik the shell perl us sigil on all access to variabl and unlik most other program languag that us sigil the sigil doesn t denot the type of the variabl but the type of the express so for exampl to access a list of valu in a hash the sigil for an arrai is us not the sigil for a hash perl also ha mani built in function

from awk and regular express from sed these simplifi and facilit mani pars text handl and data manag task also share with lisp ar the implicit return of the last valu in a block and the fact that all statement have a valu and thu ar also express and can be us in larger express themselv perl ad featur that support complex data structur first class function that is closur as valu and an object orient program model these includ refer packag class base method dispatch and lexic scope variabl along with compil direct for exampl the strict pragma a major addit featur introduc with perl wa the abil to packag code as reusabl modul wall later state that the whole intent of perl s modul system wa to encourag the growth of perl cultur rather than the perl core all version of perl do automat

circular data structur without manual intervent legal type convers for exampl convers from number to string ar done automat at run time illeg type convers ar fatal error design edit the design of perl can be understood as a respons to three broad trend in the comput industri fall hardwar cost rise labor cost and improv in compil technolog mani earlier comput languag such as fortran and c aim to make effici us of expens comput hardwar in contrast perl wa design so that comput programm could write program more quickli and easili perl ha mani featur that eas the task of the programm at the expens of greater cpu and memori requir these includ automat memori manag dynam type string list and hash regular express introspect and an eval function perl follow the theori of no built in limit an idea similar to the zero on infin rule wall wa train as a linguist and the design of perl is veri much inform by linguist principl exampl includ huffman code common construct should be short good end weight the import inform should come first and a larg collect of languag primit perl favor languag construct that ar concis and natur for human to write even where thei complic the perl interpret perl s syntax reflect the idea that thing that ar differ should look differ for exampl scalar arrai and hash have differ lead sigil arrai indic and hash kei us differ kind of brace string and regular express have differ standard delimit thi approach can be contrast with languag such as lisp where the same s express construct and basic syntax ar us for mani differ purpos perl doe not enforc ani particular program paradigm procedur object orient function or other or even requir the programm to choos among them there is a broad practic bent to both the perl languag and the commun and cultur that surround it the prefac to program perl begin perl is a languag for get your job done on consequ of thi is that perl is not a tidi languag it includ mani featur toler except to it rule and emploi heurist to resolv syntact ambigu becaus of the forgiv natur of the compil bug can sometim be hard to find perl s function document remark on the variant behavior of built in function in list and scalar context by sai in gener thei do what you want unless you want consist no written specif or standard for the perl languag exist for perl version through perl and there ar no plan to creat on for the current version of perl there ha been onli on implement of the interpret and the languag ha evolv along with it that interpret togeth with it function test stand as a de facto specif of the

coderef file handl ar repres in the interpret by c struct oper on these struct ar defin by a larg collect of macro typedef and function these constitut the perl c api the perl api can be bewild to the uniniti but it entri point follow a consist name scheme which provid guidanc to those who us it the life of a perl interpret divid broadli into a compil phase and a run phase in perl the phase ar the major stage in the interpret s life cycl each interpret goe through each phase onli onc and the phase follow in a fix sequenc most of what happen in perl s compil phase is compil and most of what happen in perl s run phase is execut but there ar signific except perl make import us of it capabl to execut perl code dure the compil phase perl will also delai compil into the run phase the term that indic the kind of process that is actual occur at ani moment ar compil time and run time perl is in compil time at most point dure the compil phase but compil time mai also be enter dure the run phase the compil time for code in a string argument pass to the eval built in occur dure the run phase perl is often in run time dure the compil phase and spend most of the run phase in run time code in begin block execut at run time but in the compil phase at compil time the interpret pars perl code into a syntax tree at run time it execut the program by walk the tree text is pars onli onc and the syntax tree is subject to optim befor it is execut so that execut is rel effici compil time optim on the syntax tree includ constant fold and context propag but peephol optim is also perform perl ha a ture complet grammar becaus pars can be affect by run time code execut dure the compil phase therefor perl cannot be pars by a straight lex yacc lexer parser combin instead the interpret implement it own lexer which coordin with a modifi gnu bison parser to resolv ambigu in the languag it is often said that onli perl can pars perl mean that onli the perl interpret perl can pars the perl languag perl but even thi is not in gener true becaus the perl interpret can simul a ture machin dure it compil phase it would need to decid the halt problem in order to complet pars in everi case it is a long stand result that the halt problem is undecid and therefor not even perl can alwai pars perl perl make the unusu choic of give the user access to it full program power in it own compil phase the cost in term of theoret puriti is high but practic inconveni seem to be rare other program that undertak to pars perl such as sourc code analyz and auto indent have to contend not onli with ambigu syntact construct but also with the undecid of perl pars in the gener case adam kennedi s ppi project focus on pars perl code as a document retain it integr as a document instead of pars perl as execut code that not even perl itself can alwai do it wa kennedi who first conjectur that pars perl suffer from the halt problem which wa later prove perl is distribut with over function test for core perl languag and over function test for core modul these run as part of the normal build process and extens exercis the interpret and it core modul perl develop reli on the function test to ensur that chang to the interpret do not introduc softwar bug addition perl user who see that the interpret pass it function test on their system can have a high degre of confid that it is work
