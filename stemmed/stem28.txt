product compet on the qualiti of their implement user interfac eas of us perform price and a host of other factor while keep the custom data intact and transfer even if he choos to switch to anoth compet product for busi reason post facto interoper edit post facto interoper mai be the result of the absolut market domin of a particular product in contravent of ani applic standard or if ani effect standard were not present at the time of that product s introduct the vendor behind that product can then choos to ignor ani forthcom standard and not co oper in ani standardis process at all us it near monopoli to insist that it product set the de facto standard by it veri market domin thi is not a problem if the product s implement is open and minim encumb but it mai as well be both close and heavili encumb e g by patent claim becaus of the network effect achiev interoper with such a product is both critic for ani other vendor if it wish to remain relev in the market and difficult to accomplish becaus of lack of co oper on equal term with the origin vendor who mai well see the new vendor as a potenti competitor and threat the newer implement often reli on clean room revers engin in the absenc of technic data to achiev interoper the origin vendor can provid such technic data to other often in the name of encourag competit but such data ar invari encumb and mai be of limit us avail of such data is not equival to an open standard becaus the data ar provid by the origin vendor on a discretionari basi who ha everi interest in block the effect implement of compet solut and mai subtli alter or chang it product often in newer revis so that competitor implement ar almost but not quit complet interoper lead custom to consid them unreli or of a lower qualiti these chang can either not be pass on to other vendor at all or pass on after a strateg delai maintain the market domin of the origin vendor the data themselv mai be encumb e g by patent or price lead to a depend of all compet solut on the origin vendor and possibl lead a revenu stream from the competitor custom back to the origin vendor thi revenu stream is onli a result of the origin product s market domin and not a result of ani innat superior even when the origin vendor is genuin interest in promot a healthi competit so that he mai also benefit from the result innov market post facto interoper mai often be undesir as mani defect or quirk can be directli trace back to the origin implement s technic limit although in an open process anyon mai identifi and correct such limit and the result cleaner specif mai be us by all vendor thi is more difficult post facto as custom alreadi have valuabl inform and process encod in the faulti but domin product and other vendor ar forc to replic those fault and quirk even if thei could design better solut for the sake of preserv interoper altern it can be argu that even open process ar subject to the weight of past implement and imperfect past design and that the power of the domin vendor to unilater correct or improv the system and impos the chang to all user facilit innov lack of an open standard can also becom problemat for the custom as in case of the origin vendor s inabl to fix a certain problem that is an artifact of technic limit in the origin product the custom want that fault fix but the vendor ha to maintain that faulti state even across newer revis of the same product becaus that behaviour is a de facto standard and mani more custom would have to pai the price of ani break in interoper caus by fix the origin problem and
