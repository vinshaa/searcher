c h thei ar liquid and after c h thei ar solid as the boil point of alkan is primarili determin by weight it should not be a surpris that the boil point ha almost a linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecul as a rule of thumb the boil point rise c for each carbon ad to the chain thi rule appli to other homolog seri a straight chain alkan will have a boil point higher than a branch chain alkan due to the greater surfac area in contact thu the greater van der waal forc between adjac molecul for exampl compar isobutan methylpropan and n butan butan which boil at and c and dimethylbutan and dimethylbutan which boil at and c respect for the latter case two molecul dimethylbutan can lock into each other better than the cross shape dimethylbutan henc the greater van der waal forc on the other hand cycloalkan tend to have higher boil point than their linear counterpart due to the lock conform of the molecul which give a plane of intermolecular contact citat need melt point edit the melt point of the alkan follow a similar trend to boil point for the same reason as outlin abov that is all other thing be equal the larger the molecul the higher the melt point there is on signific differ between boil point and melt point solid have more rigid and fix structur than liquid thi rigid structur requir energi to break down thu the better put togeth solid structur will requir more energi to break apart for alkan thi can be seen from the graph abov i e the blue line the odd number alkan have a lower trend in melt point than even number alkan thi is becaus even number alkan pack well in the solid phase form a well organ structur which requir more energi to break apart the odd number alkan pack less well and so the looser organ solid pack structur requir less energi to break apart the melt point of branch chain alkan can be either higher or lower than those of the correspond straight chain alkan again depend on the abil of the alkan in question to pack well in the solid phase thi is particularli true for isoalkan methyl isom which often have melt point higher than those of the linear analogu conduct and solubl edit alkan do not conduct electr nor ar thei substanti polar by an electr field for thi reason thei do not form hydrogen bond and ar insolubl in polar solvent such as water sinc the hydrogen bond between individu water molecul ar align awai from an alkan molecul the coexist of an alkan and water lead to an increas in molecular order a reduct in entropi as there is no signific bond between water molecul and alkan molecul the second law of thermodynam suggest that thi reduct in entropi should be minim by minim the contact between alkan and water alkan ar said to be hydrophob in that thei repel water their solubl in nonpolar solvent is rel good a properti that is call lipophil differ alkan ar for exampl miscibl in all proport among themselv the densiti of the alkan usual increas with increas number of carbon atom but remain less

equival orbit deriv from the combin of the s orbit and the three p orbit these orbit which have ident energi ar arrang spatial in the form of a tetrahedron the angl of co between them bond length and

alkan stereochemistri the structur formula and the bond angl ar not usual suffici to complet describ the geometri of a molecul there is a further degre of freedom for each carbon carbon bond the

of ethan eclips on the left stagger on the right ball and stick model of the two rotam of ethan ethan form the simplest case for studi the conform of alkan as there is onli on c c bond if on look down the axi of the c c bond on will see the so call newman project the hydrogen atom on both the front and rear carbon atom have an angl of between them result from the project of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane howev the torsion angl between a given hydrogen atom attach to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attach to the rear carbon can vari freeli between and thi is a

energi the stagger conform is kj mol lower in energi more stabl than the eclips conform the least stabl thi differ in energi between the two conform known as the torsion energi is low compar to the thermal energi of an ethan molecul at ambient temperatur there is constant rotat about the c c bond the time taken for an ethan molecul to pass from on stagger conform to the next equival to the rotat of on ch group by rel to the other is of the order of second the case of higher alkan is more complex but base on similar principl with the antiperiplanar conform alwai be the most favor around each carbon carbon bond for thi reason alkan ar usual shown in a zigzag arrang in diagram or in model the actual structur will alwai differ somewhat from these ideal form as the differ in energi between

secondari methylen ch tertiari methyn c h and quaternari the carbon reson of quaternari carbon atom is characterist weak due to the lack of nuclear overhaus effect and the long relax time and can be

difficult to interpret but in the case of branch chain alkan the carbon chain is preferenti cleav at tertiari or quaternari carbon due to the rel stabil of the result free radic the fragment result
