applic program interfac from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search api redirect here for other us see api disambigu for the mediawiki the softwar us by wikipedia api see mw api in comput program an applic program interfac api is a set of routin protocol and tool for build softwar applic an api express a softwar compon in term of it oper input output and underli type an api defin function that ar independ of their respect implement which allow definit and implement to vari without compromis the interfac a good api make it easier to develop a program by provid all the build block a programm then put the block togeth in addit to access databas or comput hardwar such as hard disk drive or video card an api can eas the work of program gui compon for exampl an api can facilit integr of new featur into exist applic a so call plug in api an api can also assist otherwis distinct applic with share data which can help to integr and enhanc the function of the applic api often come in the form of a librari that includ specif for routin data structur object class and variabl in other case notabl soap and rest servic an api is simpli a specif of remot call expos to the api consum an api specif can take mani form includ an intern standard such as posix vendor document such as the microsoft window api or the librari of a program languag e g the standard templat librari in c or the java api an api differ from an applic binari interfac abi in that an api is sourc code base while an abi is a binari interfac for instanc posix is an api while the linux standard base provid an abi content us api in procedur languag api in object orient languag api librari and framework api and protocol object exchang api and protocol object remot api and protocol api share and reus via virtual machin web api web us to share content implement api design releas polici public api implic api deprec api document api refer document api and copyright api exampl languag bind and interfac gener see also note refer further read us edit api in procedur languag edit in most procedur languag an api specifi a set of function or routin that accomplish a specif task or ar allow to interact with a specif softwar compon thi specif is present in a human readabl format in paper book or in electron format like ebook or as man page for exampl the math api on unix system is a specif on how to us the mathemat function includ in the math librari among these function there is a function name sqrt that can be us to comput the squar root of a given number the unix command man sqrt present the signatur of the function sqrt in the form synopsi includ math h doubl sqrt doubl x float sqrtf float x descript sqrt comput the posit squar root of the argument return on success the squar root is return if x is real and posit thi descript mean that sqrt function return the squar root of a posit float point number singl or doubl precis as anoth float point number henc the api in thi case can be interpret as the collect of the includ file us by a program written in the c languag to refer that librari function and it human readabl descript provid by the man page similarli other languag have procedur librari for exampl perl ha dedic api for the same mathemat task with built in document avail which is access us the perldoc util perldoc f sqrt sqrt expr sqrt return the squar root of expr if expr is omit return squar root of onli work on non neg operand unless you ve load the standard math complex modul api in object orient languag edit in it simplest form an object api is a descript of how object work in a given object orient languag usual it is express as a set of class with an associ list of class method for exampl in the java languag if the class scanner is to be us a class that read input from the user in text base program it is requir to import the java util scanner librari so object of type scanner can be us by invok some of the class method import java util scanner public class test public static void main string arg system out println enter your name scanner inputscann new scanner system in string name inputscann nextlin system out println your name is name inputscann close in the exampl abov method nextlin and close ar part of the api for the scanner class and henc ar describ in the document for that api e g public string nextlin advanc thi scanner past the current line and return the skip input return the line that wa skip throw nosuchelementexcept if no line found illegalstateexcept if thi scanner is close more gener in object orient languag an api usual includ a descript of a set of class definit with a set of behavior associ with those class thi abstract concept is associ with the real function expos or made avail by the class that ar implement in term of class method or more gener by all it public compon henc all public method but also possibl includ ani intern entiti made public like field constant nest object enum etc the api in thi case can be conceiv of as the total of all the method publicli expos by the class usual call the class interfac thi mean that the api prescrib the method by which on interact with handl the object deriv from the class definit more gener on can see the api as the collect of all the kind of object on can deriv from the class definit and their associ possibl behavior again the us is mediat by the public method but in thi interpret the method ar seen as a technic detail of how the behavior is implement for instanc a class repres a stack can simpli expos publicli two method push to add a new item to the stack and pop to extract the last item ideal place on top of the stack in thi case the api can be interpret as the two method pop and push or more gener as the idea that on can us an item of type stack that implement the behavior of a stack a pile expos it top to add remov element the second interpret appear more appropri in the spirit of object orient thi concept can be carri to the point where a class interfac in an api ha no method at all but onli behavior associ with it for instanc the java and lisp languag api includ the interfac name serializ which is a marker interfac that requir each class implement it to behav in a serial fashion thi doe not requir implement of a public method but rather requir ani class that implement thi interfac to be base on a represent that can be save serial at ani time a similarli the behavior of an object in a concurr multi thread environ is not necessarili determin by specif method belong to the interfac implement but still belong to the api for that class of object and should be describ in the document in thi sens in object orient languag the api defin a set of object behavior possibl mediat by a set of class method in such languag the api is still distribut as a librari for exampl the java languag librari includ a set of api that ar provid in the form of the jdk us by the develop to build new java program the jdk includ the document of the api in javadoc notat the qualiti of the document associ with an api is often a factor determin it success in term of eas of us api librari and framework edit an api is usual relat to a softwar librari the api describ and prescrib the expect behavior while the librari is an actual implement of thi set of rule a singl api can have multipl implement or none be abstract in the form of differ librari that share the same program interfac an api can also be relat to a softwar framework a framework can be base on sever librari implement sever api but unlik the normal us of an api the access to the behavior built into the framework is mediat by extend it content with new class plug into the framework itself moreov the overal program flow of control can be out of the control of the caller and in the hand of the framework via invers of control or a similar mechan api and protocol edit an api can also be an implement of a protocol when an api implement a protocol it can be base on proxi method for remot invoc that underneath reli on the commun protocol the role of the api can be exactli to hide the detail of the transport protocol e g rmi is an api that implement the jrmp protocol or the iiop as rmi iiop protocol ar usual share between differ technolog system base on given comput program languag in a given oper system and usual allow the differ technolog to exchang inform act as an abstract mediat level between the two differ environ protocol henc can be consid remot api local api instead ar usual specif to a given technolog henc an api for a given languag cannot be us in other languag unless the function call ar wrap with specif adapt librari to enabl the exchang of inform among system that us differ technolog when an api implement a protocol it can prescrib a languag neutral messag format e g soap us xml as a gener contain for the messag to be exchang similarli rest api can us both xml and json object exchang api and protocol edit an object api can prescrib a specif object exchang format that a program can us local within an applic while an object exchang protocol can defin a wai to transfer the same kind of inform in a messag sent to a remot system when a messag is exchang via a protocol between two differ platform us object on both side the object in a program languag can be transform marshal and unmarshal in an object in a remot and differ languag so e g a program written in java invok a servic via soap or iiop written in c both program us api for remot invoc each local to the machin where thei ar work to remot exchang inform that thei both convert from to an object in local memori instead when a similar object is exchang via an api local to a singl machin the object is effect exchang or a refer to it in memori e g via memori alloc by a singl process or among multipl process us share memori an applic server or other share technolog like tupl space object remot api and protocol edit an object remot api is base on a remot protocol such as corba that allow remot object method invoc a method call execut local on a proxi object invok the correspond method on the remot object us the remot protocol and acquir the result to be us local as return valu when remot is in place a modif on the proxi object correspond to a modif on the remot object when onli an object transfer take place the modif to the local copi of the object is not reflect on the origin object unless the object is sent back to the send system api share and reus via virtual machin edit some languag like those run in a virtual machin e g net cli compliant languag in the common languag runtim clr and jvm compliant languag in the java virtual machin can share an api in thi case a virtual machin enabl languag interoper by abstract a program languag us an intermedi bytecod and it languag bind in these languag the compil perform just in time compil or ahead of time compil transform the sourc code possibl written in multipl languag into it languag independ bytecod represent for instanc through the bytecod represent a program written in groovi or scala languag can us ani standard java class and henc ani java api thi is possibl thank to the fact both groovi and scala have an object model that is a superset of that of the java languag thu ani api expos via a java object is access via groovi or scala by an equival object invoc translat in bytecod on the other side groovi and scala introduc first class entiti that ar not present in java like closur these entiti cannot be nativ repres in java languag java introduc the concept of lambda express thu to enabl interoper a closur is encapsul in a standard java object in thi case the closur invoc is mediat by a method name call which is alwai present in an closur object as seen by java and in java the closur doe not repres a first class entiti web api edit main articl web api web api ar the defin interfac through which interact happen between an enterpris and applic that us it asset an api approach is an architectur approach that revolv around provid programm interfac to a set of servic to differ applic serv differ type of consum when us in the context of web develop an api is typic defin as a set of hypertext transfer protocol http request messag along with a definit of the structur of respons messag which is usual in an extens markup languag xml or javascript object

architectur soa toward more direct represent state transfer rest style web resourc and resourc orient architectur roa part of thi trend is relat to the semant web movement toward resourc descript framework rdf a concept to promot web base ontolog engin technolog web api allow the combin of multipl api into new applic known as mashup web us to share content edit the practic of publish api ha allow web commun to creat an open architectur for share content and data between commun and applic in thi wai content that is creat in on place can be dynam post and updat in multipl locat on the web photo can be share from site like flickr and photobucket to social network site like facebook and myspac content can be embed e g embed a present from slideshar on a linkedin profil content can be dynam post share live comment made on twitter with a facebook account for exampl is enabl by their api video content can be embed on site serv by anoth host user inform can be share from web commun to outsid applic deliv new function to the web commun that share it user data via an open api on of the best exampl of thi is the facebook applic platform anoth is the open social platform if content is a direct represent of the physic world e g temperatur at a geospati locat on earth then an api can be consid an environment program interfac epi epi ar character by their abil to provid a mean for

oper on mani differ system mac os x and variou berkelei softwar distribut bsd implement thi interfac howev us thi requir re compil for each platform a compat api on the other hand allow compil object code to function with no chang to the system that implement that api thi is benefici to both softwar provid where thei mai distribut exist softwar on new system without produc and distribut upgrad and user where thei mai instal older softwar on their new system without purchas upgrad although thi gener requir that variou softwar librari implement the necessari api as well microsoft ha shown a strong commit to a backward compat api particularli within their window api win librari such that older applic mai run on newer version of window us an execut specif set call compat mode among unix like oper system there ar mani relat but incompat oper system run on a common hardwar platform particularli intel compat system there have been sever attempt to standard the api such that softwar vendor mai distribut on binari applic for all these system howev to date none of these ha met with much success the linux standard base is attempt to do thi for the linux platform while mani of the bsd unix such as freebsd netbsd and openbsd implement variou level of api compat for both backward compat allow program written for older version to run on newer distribut of the system and cross platform compat allow execut of foreign code without recompil api design edit sever principl ar commonli us to govern the process of design api parna propos the concept of inform hide in the principl of inform hide is that on mai divid softwar into modul each of which ha a specifi interfac the interfac hide the implement detail of the modul so that user of modul need not understand the complex insid the modul these interfac ar api and as a result api should expos onli those modul detail that client must know to us modul effect softwar architectur is dedic to creat and maintain high level softwar structur which typic includ modul api reflect interfac between modul thu a system architectur is inextric relat to the api that express that architectur howev mani decis involv in creat api ar not architectur such as name convent and mani detail on how interfac ar structur these detail of how interfac ar structur as well as the softwar architectur have signific impact on softwar qualiti for exampl cataldo et al found that buggi is correl with logic and data depend in softwar thi impli that to reduc bug rate softwar develop should carefulli consid api depend conwai s law state that the structur of a system inevit reflect the structur of the organ that creat it thi suggest that to understand how api ar design in the real world on must also understand the structur of softwar engin organ likewis an api group should structur itself accord to what the api need in a studi of microsoft softwar engin begel et al found that in addit to coordin regard api design softwar engin even more commonli coordin regard schedul and featur thi reinforc the view that softwar organ collabor extens and that organiz structur is import sever author have creat recommend for how to design api such as joshua bloch and michi hen howev sinc on of the principl of api design is that an api should be consist with other api alreadi in us in the system the detail of api design ar somewhat languag and
