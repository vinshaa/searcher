http edit spdy doe not replac http it modifi the wai http request and respons ar sent over the wire thi mean that all exist server side applic can be us without modif if a spdy compat translat layer is put in place spdy is effect a tunnel for the http and http protocol when sent over spdy http request ar process token simplifi and compress for exampl each spdy endpoint keep track of which header
