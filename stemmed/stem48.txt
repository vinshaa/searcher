program everi program languag ha some form of a runtim system includ compil languag interpret languag embed domain specif languag or those invok via an api such as pthread in addit to the behavior of the languag construct a runtim system mai also perform support servic such as type check debug or code gener and optim the runtim system is also the gatewai by which a run program interact with the runtim environ which contain state valu that ar access dure program execut as well as activ entiti that can be interact with dure program execut for exampl environ variabl ar featur of mani oper system and ar part of the runtim environ a run program can access them via the runtim system likewis hardwar devic such as a dvd drive ar activ entiti that a program can interact with via a runtim system content overview histori see also refer overview edit as a simpl exampl of a basic runtim system the runtim system of the c languag is a particular set of instruct insert into the execut imag by the compil among other thing these instruct manag the processor stack creat space for local variabl and copi function call paramet onto the top of the stack there ar often no clear criteria for decid which languag behavior is consid insid the runtim system versu which behavior is compil in thi case the reason that c s stack behavior is part of the runtim system as oppos to part of a keyword of the languag is that it is systemat maintain the state of the stack throughout a program s execut the systemat behavior implement the execut model of the languag as oppos to implement semant of particular keyword which ar directli translat into code that comput result anoth exampl which illumin the natur of a runtim system is the case of us an applic program interfac api to interact with a runtim system the call to that api look the same as call to a regular softwar librari howev at some point dure the call the execut model chang the runtim system implement an execut model differ from that of the languag the librari is written in term of a person read the code of a normal librari would be abl to understand the librari s behavior by just know the languag the librari wa written in howev a person read the code of the api that invok a runtim system would not be abl to understand the behavior of the api call just by know the languag the call wa written in at some point via some mechan the execut model stop be that of the languag the call is written in and switch over to be the execut model implement by the runtim system for exampl the trap instruct is on method of switch execut model thi differ is what distinguish an api invok execut model such as posix thread from a usual softwar librari both posix thread call and softwar librari call ar invok via an api but posix thread behavior cannot be understood in term of the languag of the call rather posix thread call bring into plai an outsid execut model which is implement by the posix thread runtim system thi runtim system is often the os kernel some compil or interpret languag provid an interfac that allow applic code to interact directli with the runtim system an exampl is the thread class in the java languag which allow code that is anim by on thread to do thing such as start and stop other thread normal core aspect of a languag s behavior such as task schedul and resourc manag ar not access in thi fashion higher level behavior implement by a runtim system mai includ task such as draw text on the screen or make an internet connect it is often the case that oper system provid these kind of behavior as well and when avail the runtim system is implement as an abstract layer that translat the invoc of the runtim system into an invoc of the oper system thi hide the complex or variat in the servic offer by differ oper system thi also impli that the os kernel can be view as a runtim system and that the set of os call that invok os behavior mai be view as an api invok languag in the limit the runtim system mai provid servic such as a p code machin or virtual machin that hide even the processor s instruct set thi is the approach follow by mani interpret languag such as awk and some languag like java which ar meant to be compil into some machin independ pseudocod bytecod thi arrang greatli simplifi the task of languag implement and it adapt to differ machin and improv effici of sophist languag featur such as reflect it also allow the same program to be execut on ani machin without an explicit recompil step a featur that ha becom veri import sinc the prolifer of the world wide web to speed up execut some runtim system featur just in time compil to machin code at the other extrem the physic cpu itself can be view as an implement of the runtim system of a specif assembl languag in thi view the execut model is implement by the physic cpu and memori system as an analog runtim system for higher level languag ar themselv implement us some other languag thi creat a hierarchi of runtim system with the cpu itself or actual it inner digit logic structur that determin thing like program counter advanc and schedul of instruct act as the lowest level runtim system a modern aspect of runtim system is parallel execut behavior such as the behavior exhibit by mutex construct in pthread and parallel section construct in openmp a runtim system with such parallel execut behavior mai be modular accord to the proto runtim approach histori edit notabl earli exampl of runtim system ar the interpret for basic and lisp these environ also includ a garbag collector forth is an earli exampl of a languag that wa design to be compil into pseudocod it runtim system wa a virtual machin that interpret that pseudocod anoth popular if theoret exampl is donald knuth s mix comput in c and later languag that support dynam memori alloc the runtim system also includ a librari that manag the program s memori pool in the object orient program languag the runtim system wa often also
