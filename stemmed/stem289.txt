render the scene in the canva exampl abov onc the rectangl is drawn the fact that it wa drawn is forgotten by the system if it posit were to be chang the entir scene would need to be redrawn includ ani object that might have been cover by the rectangl but in the equival svg case on could simpli chang the posit attribut of the rectangl and the browser would determin how to repaint it there ar addit javascript librari that add scene graph capabl to the canva element it is also possibl to paint a canva in layer and then recreat specif layer svg imag ar repres in xml and complex scene can be creat and maintain with xml edit tool the svg scene graph enabl event handler to be associ with object so a rectangl mai respond to an onclick event to get the same function with canva on must manual match the coordin of the mous click with the coordin of the drawn rectangl to determin whether it wa click conceptu canva is a lower level api upon which an engin support for exampl svg might be built there ar javascript librari that provid partial svg implement us canva for browser that do not provid svg but support canva such as the browser in android x howev thi is not normal the case thei ar
