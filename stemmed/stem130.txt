request thei most commonli implement applic host on web server such web servlet ar the java counterpart to other dynam web content technolog such as php and asp net content introduct histori compar with other web applic model life cycl of a servlet exampl contain server refer extern link introduct edit servlet ar most often us to citat need process or store a java class in java ee that conform to the java servlet api a standard for implement java class which respond to request servlet could in principl commun over ani client server protocol but thei ar most often us with the http protocol thu servlet is often us as shorthand for http servlet thu a softwar develop mai us a servlet to add dynam content to a web server us the java platform the gener content is commonli html but mai be other data such as xml servlet can maintain state in session variabl across mani server transact by us http cooki or url rewrit to deploi and run a servlet a web contain must be us a web contain also known as a servlet contain is essenti the compon of a web server that interact with the servlet the web contain is respons for manag the lifecycl of servlet map a url to a particular servlet and ensur that the url request ha the correct access right the servlet api contain in the java packag hierarchi javax servlet defin the expect interact of the web contain and a servlet a servlet is an object that receiv a request and gener a respons base on that request the basic servlet packag defin java object to repres servlet request and respons as well as object to reflect the servlet s configur paramet and execut environ the packag javax servlet http defin http specif subclass of the gener servlet element includ session manag object that track multipl request and respons between the web server and a client servlet mai be packag in a war file as a web applic servlet can be gener automat from java server page jsp by the javaserv page compil the differ between servlet and jsp is that servlet typic emb html insid java code while jsp emb java code in html while the direct usag of servlet to gener html as shown in the exampl below ha becom rare the higher level mvc web framework in java ee jsf still explicitli us the servlet technolog for the low level request respons handl via the facesservlet a somewhat older usag is to us servlet in conjunct with jsp in a pattern call model which is a flavor of the model view control the current version of servlet is histori edit the servlet specif wa creat by sun microsystem with version final in june start with version the specif wa

more power over tradit cgi common gatewai interfac tradit cgi script written in java have a number of perform disadvantag when an http request is made a new process is creat each time the cgi script is call the overhead associ with process creation can domin the workload especi when the script doe rel fast oper thu process creation will take more time for cgi script execut in contrast for servlet each request is handl by a separ java thread within the web server process therebi avoid the overhead associ with fork process within the http daemon simultan cgi request will load the cgi script to be copi into memori onc per request with servlet there is onli on copi that persist across request and is share between thread onli a singl instanc answer all request concurr thi reduc memori usag and eas the manag of persist data a servlet can be run by a servlet contain in a restrict environ call a sandbox thi is similar to an applet that run in the sandbox of the web browser thi enabl restrict us of potenti harm servlet cgi program can of cours also sandbox themselv sinc thei ar simpli os process technolog like fastcgi and it deriv includ scgi wsgi do not exhibit the perform disadvantag of cgi incur by the constant process spawn thei ar howev roughli as simpl as cgi thei ar therefor also in contrast with servlet which ar substanti more complex life cycl of a servlet edit three method ar central to the life cycl of a servlet these ar init servic and destroi thei ar implement by everi servlet and ar invok at specif time by the server dure initi stage of the servlet life cycl the web contain initi the servlet instanc by call the init method pass an object implement the javax servlet servletconfig interfac thi configur object allow the servlet to access name valu initi paramet from the web applic after initi the servlet instanc can servic client request each request is servic in it own separ thread the web contain call the servic method of the servlet for everi request the servic method determin the kind of request be made and dispatch it to an appropri method to handl the request the develop of the servlet must provid an implement for these method if a request is made for a method that is not implement by the servlet the method of the parent class is call typic result in an error be return to the request final the web contain call the destroi method that take the servlet out of servic the destroi method like init is call onli onc in the lifecycl of a servlet the follow is a typic user scenario of these method assum that a user request to visit a url the browser then gener an http request for thi url thi request is then sent to the appropri server the http request is receiv by the web server and forward to the servlet contain the contain map thi request to a particular servlet the servlet is dynam retriev and load into the address space of the contain the contain invok the init method of the servlet thi method is invok onli when the servlet is first load into memori it is possibl to pass initi paramet to the servlet so that it mai configur itself the contain invok the servic method of the servlet thi method is call to process the http request the servlet mai read data that ha been provid in the http request the servlet mai also formul an http respons for the client the servlet remain in the contain s address space and is avail to process ani other http request receiv from client the servic method is call for each http request the contain mai at some point decid to unload the servlet from it memori the algorithm by which thi decis is made ar specif to each contain the contain call the servlet s destroi method to relinquish ani resourc such as file handl that ar alloc for the servlet import data mai be save to a persist
