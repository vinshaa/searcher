web resourc from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search the concept of a web resourc is primit in the web architectur and is us in the definit of it fundament element the term wa first introduc to refer to target of uniform resourc locat url but it definit ha been further extend to includ the refer of ani uniform resourc identifi rfc or internation resourc identifi rfc in the semant web abstract resourc and their semant properti ar describ us the famili of languag base on resourc descript framework rdf content histori from document and file to web resourc from web resourc to abstract resourc resourc in rdf and the semant web us http uri to identifi abstract resourc resourc ownership intellectu properti and trust see also refer histori edit the concept of a web resourc ha evolv dure the web histori from the earli notion of static address document or file to a more gener and abstract definit now encompass everi thing or entiti that can be identifi name address or handl in ani wai whatsoev in the web at larg or in ani network inform system the declar aspect of a resourc identif and name and it function aspect address and technic handl were not clearli distinct in the earli specif of the web and the veri definit of the concept ha been the subject of long and still open debat involv difficult and often arcan technic social linguist and philosoph issu from document and file to web resourc edit in the earli specif of the web the term resourc is bare us at all the web is design as a network of more or less static address object basic file and document link us uniform resourc locat url a web resourc is implicitli defin as someth which can be identifi the identif deserv two distinct purpos name and address the latter onli depend on a protocol it is notabl that rfc doe not attempt to defin at all the notion of resourc actual it bare us the term besid it occurr in uri url and urn and still speak about object of the network rfc decemb further specifi url the term univers be chang to uniform the document is make a more systemat us of resourc to refer to object which ar avail or can be locat and access through the internet there again the term resourc itself is not explicitli defin from web resourc to abstract resourc edit the first explicit definit of resourc is found in rfc in august a resourc can be anyth that ha ident familiar exampl includ an electron document an imag a servic e g todai s weather report for lo angel and a collect of other resourc not all resourc ar network retriev e g human be corpor and bound book in a librari can also be consid resourc although exampl in thi document were still limit to physic entiti the definit open the door to more abstract resourc provid a concept is given an ident and thi ident is express by a well form uri uniform resourc identifi a superset of url then a concept can be a resourc as well in januari rfc make thi extens of the definit complet explicit abstract concept can be resourc such as the oper and operand of a mathemat equat the type of a relationship e g parent or employe or numer valu e g zero on and infin resourc in rdf and the semant web edit first releas in rdf wa first intend to describ resourc in other word to declar metadata of resourc in a standard wai a rdf descript of a resourc is a set of tripl subject predic object where subject repres the resourc to be describ predic a type of properti relev to thi resourc and object can be data or anoth resourc the predic itself is consid as a resourc and identifi by a uri henc properti like titl author ar repres in rdf as resourc which can be us in a recurs wai as the subject of other tripl build on thi recurs principl rdf vocabulari such as rdf owl and sko will pile up definit of abstract resourc such as class properti concept all identifi by uri rdf also specifi the definit of anonym resourc or blank node which ar not absolut identifi by uri us http uri to identifi abstract resourc edit url particularli http uri ar frequent us to identifi abstract resourc such as class properti or other kind of concept exampl can be found in rdf or owl ontolog sinc such uri ar associ with the http protocol the question aros of which kind of represent if ani should on get for such resourc through thi protocol typic us a web browser and if the syntax of the uri itself could help to differenti abstract resourc from inform resourc the uri specif such as rfc left to the protocol specif the task of defin action perform on the resourc and thei don t provid ani answer to thi question it had been suggest that an http uri identifi a resourc in the origin sens such as a file document or ani kind of so call inform resourc should be slash uri in other word should not contain a fragment identifi wherea a uri us to identifi a concept or abstract resourc should be a hash uri us a fragment identifi for exampl http www exampl org catalogu widget html would both identifi and locat a web page mayb provid some human readabl descript of the widget sold by silli widget inc wherea http www exampl org ontolog widget would identifi the abstract concept or class widget in thi compani ontolog and would not necessarili retriev ani physic resourc through http protocol but it ha been answer that such a distinct is imposs to enforc in practic and famou standard vocabulari provid counter exampl wide us for exampl the dublin core concept such as titl publish creator ar identifi by slash uri like http purl org dc element titl the gener question of which kind of resourc http uri should or should not identifi ha been formerli known in w c as the httprang issu follow it name on the list defin by the technic architectur group tag the tag ha deliv in a final answer to thi issu make the distinct between an inform resourc and a non inform resourc depend on the type of answer given by the server to a get request xx success indic resourc is an inform resourc see other indic the resourc could be inform or abstract the redirect target could tell you xx client error provid no inform at all thi allow vocabulari like dublin core foaf and wordnet to continu to us slash instead of hash for pragmat reason while thi compromis seem to have met a consensu in the semant web commun some of it promin member such as pat hay have express concern both on it technic feasibl and conceptu foundat accord to patrick hay viewpoint the veri distinct between inform resourc and other resourc is imposs to find and should better not be specifi at all and ambigu of the refer resourc is inher to uri like to ani name mechan resourc ownership intellectu properti and trust edit in rdf anybodi can declar anyth about anyth resourc ar defin by formal descript which anyon can publish copi modifi and publish over the web if the content of a web resourc in the classic sens a web page or on line file is clearli own by it publish who can claim intellectu properti on it an abstract resourc can be defin by an accumul of rdf descript not necessarili control by a uniqu publish and not necessarili consist with each other it s an open issu to know if a resourc should have an authorit definit with clear and trustabl ownership and in thi case how to make thi descript technic distinct from other descript a parallel issu is how intellectu properti mai appli to such descript see also edit resourc comput scienc resourc orient
