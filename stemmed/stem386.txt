arithmet mean from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search for a broader coverag relat to thi topic see mean thi articl need addit citat for verif pleas help improv thi articl by ad citat to reliabl sourc unsourc materi mai be challeng and remov juli in mathemat and statist the arithmet mean pronunci r m t k mi n stress on third syllabl of arithmet or simpli the mean or averag when the context is clear is the sum of a collect of number divid by the number of number in the collect the collect is often a set of result of an experi or a set of result from a survei the term arithmet mean is prefer in some context in mathemat and statist becaus it help distinguish it from other mean such as the geometr mean and the harmon mean in addit to mathemat and statist the arithmet mean is us frequent in field such as econom sociolog and histori and it is us in almost everi academ field to some extent for exampl per capita incom is the arithmet averag incom of a nation s popul while the arithmet mean is often us to report central tendenc it is not a robust statist mean that it is greatli influenc by outlier valu that ar veri much larger or smaller than most of the valu notabl for skew distribut such as the distribut of incom for which a few peopl s incom ar substanti greater than most peopl s the arithmet mean mai not accord with on s notion of middl and robust statist such as the median mai be a better descript of central tendenc in a more obscur usag ani sequenc of valu that form an arithmet sequenc between two number x and y can be call arithmet mean between x and y content definit motiv properti contrast with median gener weight averag continu probabl distribut angl see also refer further read extern link definit edit the arithmet mean or mean or averag is the most commonli us and readili understood measur of central tendenc in statist the term averag refer to ani of the measur of central tendenc the arithmet mean is defin as be equal to the sum of the numer valu of each and everi observ divid by the total number of observ symbol if we have a data set contain the valu the arithmet mean is defin by the formula see summat for an explan of the summat oper for exampl let us consid the monthli salari of employe of a firm the arithmet mean is if the data set is a statist popul i e consist of everi possibl observ and not just a subset of them then the mean of that popul is call the popul mean if the data set is a statist sampl a subset of the popul we call the statist result from thi calcul a sampl mean the arithmet mean of a variabl is often denot by a bar for exampl as in read bar which is the mean of the valu motiv properti edit the arithmet mean ha sever properti that make it us especi as a measur of central tendenc these includ if number have mean then sinc is the distanc from a given number to the mean on wai to interpret thi properti is as sai that the number to the left of the mean ar balanc by the number to the right of the mean the mean is the onli singl number for which the residu deviat from the estim sum to zero if it is requir to us a singl number as a typic valu for a set of known number then the arithmet mean of the number doe thi best in the sens of minim the sum of squar deviat from the typic valu the sum of it follow that the sampl mean is also the best singl predictor in the sens of have the lowest root mean squar error if the arithmet mean of a popul of number is desir then the estim of it that is unbias is the arithmet mean of a sampl drawn from the popul contrast with median edit the arithmet mean mai be contrast with the median the median is defin such that half the valu ar larger than and half ar smaller than the median if element in the sampl data increas arithmet when place in some order then the median and arithmet averag ar equal for exampl consid the data sampl the averag is as is the median howev when we consid a sampl that cannot be arrang so as to increas arithmet such as the median and arithmet averag can differ significantli in thi case the arithmet averag is and the median is in gener the averag valu can vari significantli from most valu in the sampl and can be larger or smaller than most of them there ar applic of thi phenomenon in mani field for exampl sinc the s the median incom in the unit state ha increas more slowli than the arithmet averag of incom gener edit weight averag edit a weight averag or weight mean is an averag in which some data point count more strongli than other in that thei ar given more weight in the calcul for exampl the arithmet mean of and is or equival in contrast a weight mean in which the first number receiv for exampl twice as much weight as the second perhap becaus it is assum to appear twice as often in the gener popul from which these number were sampl would be calcul as here the weight which necessarili sum to the valu on ar and the former be twice the latter note that the arithmet mean sometim call the unweight averag or equal weight averag can be interpret as a special case of a weight averag in which all the weight ar equal to each other equal to in the abov exampl and equal to in a situat with number be averag continu probabl distribut edit comparison of mean median and mode of two log normal distribut with differ skew when a popul of number and ani sampl of data from it could take on ani of a continu rang of number instead of for exampl just integ then the probabl of a number fall into on rang of possibl valu could differ from the probabl of fall into a differ rang of possibl valu even if the length of both rang ar the same in such a case the set of probabl can be describ us a continu probabl distribut the analog of a weight averag in thi context in which there ar an infinitud of possibl for the precis valu of the variabl is call the mean of the probabl distribut the most wide encount probabl distribut is call the normal distribut it ha the properti that all measur of it central tendenc includ not just the mean but also the aforement median and the mode ar equal to each other thi properti doe not hold howev in the case of a great mani probabl distribut such as the lognorm distribut illustr here angl edit main articl mean of circular quantiti particular care must be taken when us cyclic data such as phase or angl na veli take the arithmet mean of and yield a result of thi is incorrect for two reason firstli angl measur ar onli defin up to an addit constant of or if measur in radian thu on could as easili call these and or and each of which give a differ averag secondli in thi situat equival is geometr a better averag valu there is lower dispers about it the point ar both from it and from the put averag in gener applic such an oversight will lead to the averag valu artifici move toward the middl of the numer rang a solut to thi problem is to us the optim formul viz defin the mean as the central point the point about which on ha the lowest dispers and redefin the differ as a modular distanc i e the distanc on the circl so the modular distanc between and is not see also edit averagefréchet meangener meangeometr meanmodesampl mean and covariancesummari statist
