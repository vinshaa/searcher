environ variabl from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search environ variabl ar a set of dynam name valu that can affect the wai run process will behav on a comput thei ar part of the environ in which a process run for exampl a run process can queri the valu of the temp environ variabl to discov a suitabl locat to store temporari file or the home or userprofil variabl to find the directori structur own by the user run the process thei were introduc in their modern form in with version unix so ar includ in all unix oper system flavor and variant from that point onward includ linux and os x from pc do in all succeed microsoft oper system includ microsoft window and os also have includ them as a featur although with somewhat differ syntax usag and standard variabl name content detail us and displai assign true environ variabl unix do gem os window default valu pseudo environ variabl do window critic see also refer extern link detail edit in all unix and unix like system each process ha it own separ set of environ variabl by default when a process is creat it inherit a duplic environ of it parent process except for explicit chang made by the parent when it creat the child at the api level these chang must be done between run fork and exec altern from command shell such as bash a user can chang environ variabl for a particular command invoc by indirectli invok it via env or us the environ variabl valu command notat all unix oper system flavor do and window have environ variabl howev thei do not all us the same variabl name a run program can access the valu of environ variabl for configur purpos exampl of environ variabl includ path a list of directori path when the user type a command without provid the full path thi list is check to see whether it contain a path that lead to the command home unix like and userprofil microsoft window indic where a user s home directori is locat in the file system home appnam unix like and appdata developernam appnam microsoft window for store applic set mani applic incorrectli us userprofil for applic set in window userprofil should onli be us in dialog that allow user to choos between path like document pictur download music for programmat purpos appdata roam localappdata or programdata share between user is us term unix like specifi the type of comput termin or termin emul be us e g vt or dumb ps unix like specifi how the prompt is displai in the bourn shell and variant mail unix like us to indic where a user s mail is to be found temp locat where process can store temporari file shell script and batch file us environ variabl to commun data and prefer to child process thei can also be us to store temporari valu for refer later in a shell script howev in unix other variabl ar usual us for thi in unix an environ variabl that is chang in a script or compil program will onli affect that process and possibl child process the parent process and ani unrel process will not be affect in ms do chang or remov a variabl s valu insid a batch file will chang the variabl for the durat of command com s exist in unix the environ variabl ar normal initi dure system startup by the system init script and henc inherit by all other process in the system user can and often do augment them in the profil script for the command shell thei ar us in microsoft window each environ variabl s default valu is store in the window registri or set in the autoexec bat file on unix a setuid program is given an environ chosen by it caller but it run with differ author from it caller the dynam linker will usual load code from locat specifi by the environ variabl ld librari path and ld preload and run it with the process s author if a setuid program did thi it would be insecur becaus it caller could get it to run arbitrari code and henc misus it author for thi reason libc unset these environ variabl at startup in a setuid process setuid program usual unset unknown environ variabl and check other or set them to reason valu us and displai edit the variabl can be us both in script and on the command line thei ar usual referenc by put special symbol in front of or around the variabl name for instanc to displai the user home directori in most script environ the user ha to type echo home on do os or window system the user ha to type thi echo home in window powershel the user ha to type thi write output env homepath the command env set and printenv displai all environ variabl and their valu printenv can also be us to print a singl variabl by give that variabl name as the sole argument to the command assign edit env and set ar also us to set environ variabl and ar often incorpor directli into the shell in unix the follow command can also be us but ar often depend on a certain shell variabl valu export variabl for bourn and relat shell export variabl valu for ksh bash and relat shell setenv variabl valu for csh and relat shell a few simpl principl govern how environ variabl achiev their effect environ variabl ar local to the process in which thei were set if two shell process ar spawn and the valu of an environ variabl is chang in on that chang will not be seen by the other when a child process is creat it inherit all the environ variabl and their valu from the parent process usual when a program call anoth program it first creat a child process by fork then the child adjust the environ as need and lastli the child replac itself with the program to be call thi procedur give the call program control over the environ of the call program in unix and unix like system the name of environ variabl ar case sensit in unix shell variabl mai be assign without the export keyword variabl defin in thi wai ar displai by the set command but ar not true environ variabl as thei ar store onli by the shell and not recogn by the kernel the printenv command will not displai them and child process do not inherit them variabl valu howev if us in front of a program to run the variabl will be export to the environ and thu appear as real environ variabl to the program variabl valu program name argument the persist of an environ variabl can be session wide or system wide in do os and window the set command is us to assign environ variabl and valu us the follow argument set variabl valu the set command without ani argument displai all environ variabl along with their valu true environ variabl edit unix edit pathcontain a colon separ list of directori that the shell search for command that do not contain a slash in their name command with slash ar interpret as file name to execut and the shell attempt to execut the file directli it is equival to the do os and window path variabl see also path comput homecontain the locat of the user s home directori although the current user s home directori can also be found out through the c function getpwuid and getuid home is often us for conveni in variou shell script and other context us the environ variabl also give the user the possibl to point to anoth directori pwdthi variabl point to the current directori equival to the output of the command pwd when call without argument displaycontain the identifi for the displai that x program should us by default ld librari pathon mani unix system with a dynam linker contain a colon separ list of directori that the dynam linker should search for share object when build a

function is limit to charact and is no longer avail when fcb get expand or the default dta is us while do support longer command line command com still onli support a maximum of charact at the prompt by default unless overridden with u to specifi the size of the command line buffer but nevertheless intern command line can becom longer through f e variabl expans depend on l to specifi the size of the intern buffer in addit to the command line length byte in the psp the psp command line is normal limit by ascii and command line longer than charact will typic be truncat by have an ascii insert at posit but thi cannot be reli upon in all scenario the variabl will be suppress for extern command invok with a preced symbol like in xcopi for backward compat and in order to minim the size of the
