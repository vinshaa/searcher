ietf to explor new technolog to expand the address capabl in the internet the perman solut wa deem to be a redesign of the internet protocol itself thi new gener of the internet protocol wa eventu name internet protocol version ipv in the address size wa increas from to bit octet thu provid up to approxim address thi is deem suffici for the forese futur the intent of the new design wa not to provid just a suffici quantiti of address but also redesign rout in the internet by more effici aggreg of subnetwork rout prefix the result in slower growth of rout tabl in router the smallest possibl individu alloc is a subnet for host which is the squar of the size of the entir ipv internet at these level actual address util rate will be small on ani ipv network segment the new design also provid the opportun to separ the address infrastructur of a network segment i e the local administr of the segment s avail space from the address prefix us to rout traffic to and from extern network ipv ha facil that automat chang the rout prefix of entir network should the global connect or the rout polici chang without requir intern redesign or manual renumb the larg number of ipv address allow larg block to be assign for specif purpos and where appropri to be aggreg for effici rout with a larg address space there is no need to have complex address conserv method as us in cidr all modern desktop and enterpris server oper system includ nativ support for the ipv protocol but it is not yet wide deploi in other devic such as residenti network router voic over ip voip and multimedia equip and network peripher privat address just as ipv reserv address for privat network block of address ar set asid in ipv in ipv these ar refer to as uniqu local address ula rfc reserv the rout prefix fc for

thi provid instant and automat commun between all ipv host on a link thi featur is requir in the lower layer of ipv network administr such as for the neighbor discoveri protocol privat address prefix mai not be rout on the public internet ip subnetwork ip network mai be divid into subnetwork in both ipv and ipv for thi purpos an ip address is logic recogn as consist of two part the network prefix and the host identifi or interfac identifi ipv the subnet mask or the cidr prefix determin how the ip address is divid into network and host part the term subnet mask is onli us within ipv both ip version howev us the cidr concept and notat in thi the ip address is follow by a slash and the number in decim of bit us for the network part also call the rout prefix for exampl an ipv address and it subnet mask mai be and respect the cidr notat for the same ip address and subnet is becaus the first bit of the ip address indic the network and subnet ip address assign internet protocol address ar assign to a host either anew at the time of boot or perman by fix configur of it hardwar or softwar persist configur is also known as us a static ip address in contrast in situat when the comput s ip address is assign newli each time thi is known as us a dynam ip address method static ip address ar manual assign to a comput by an administr the exact procedur vari accord to platform thi contrast with dynam ip address which ar assign either by the comput interfac or host softwar itself as in zeroconf or assign by a server us dynam host configur protocol dhcp even though ip address assign us dhcp mai stai the same for long period of time thei can gener chang in some case a network administr mai implement dynam assign static ip address in thi case a dhcp server is us but it is specif configur to alwai assign the same ip address to a particular comput thi allow static ip address to be configur central without have to specif configur each comput on the network in a manual procedur in the absenc or failur of static or state dhcp address configur an oper system mai assign an ip address to a network interfac us state less auto configur method such as zeroconf us of dynam address assign ip address ar most frequent assign dynam on lan and broadband network by the dynam host configur protocol dhcp thei ar us becaus it avoid the administr burden of assign specif static address to each devic on a network it also allow mani devic to share limit address space on a network if onli some of them will be onlin at a particular time in most current desktop oper system dynam ip configur is enabl by default so that a user doe not need to manual enter ani set to connect to a network with a dhcp server dhcp is not the onli technolog us to assign ip address dynam dialup and some broadband network us dynam address featur of the point to point protocol sticki dynam ip address a sticki dynam ip address is an inform term us by cabl and dsl internet access subscrib to describ a dynam assign ip address which seldom chang the address ar usual assign with dhcp sinc the modem ar usual power on for extend period of time the address leas ar usual set to long period and simpli

such as a local network segment or point to point connect that a host is connect to these address ar not routabl and like privat address cannot be the sourc or destin of packet travers the internet when the link local ipv address block wa reserv no standard exist for mechan of address autoconfigur fill the void microsoft creat an implement that is call automat privat ip address apipa apipa ha

static address some infrastructur situat have to us static address such as when find the domain name system dn host that will translat domain name to ip address static address ar also conveni but not absolut necessari to locat server insid an enterpris an address obtain from a dn server come with a time to live or cach time after which it should be look up to confirm that it ha not chang even static ip address do chang as a result of network administr rfc rout ip address ar classifi into sever class of oper characterist unicast multicast anycast and broadcast address unicast address the most common concept of an ip address is in unicast address avail in both ipv and ipv it normal refer to a singl sender or a singl receiv and can be us for both send and receiv usual a unicast address is associ with a singl devic or host but a devic or host mai have more than on unicast address some individu pc have sever distinct unicast address each for it own distinct purpos send the same data to multipl unicast address requir the sender to send all the data mani time over onc for each recipi broadcast address main articl broadcast comput in ipv it is possibl to send data to all possibl destin all host broadcast which permit the sender to send the data onli onc and all receiv receiv a copi of it in the ipv protocol the address is us for local broadcast in addit a direct limit broadcast can be made by combin the network prefix with a host suffix compos entir of binari s for exampl the destin address us for a direct broadcast to devic on the network is ipv doe not implement broadcast address and replac it with multicast to the special defin all node multicast address multicast address a multicast address is associ with a group of interest receiv in ipv address through the former class d address ar design as multicast address ipv us the address block with the prefix ff for multicast applic in either case the sender send a singl datagram from it unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediari router take care of make copi and send them to all receiv that have join the correspond multicast group anycast address like broadcast and multicast anycast is a on to mani rout topolog howev the data stream is not transmit to all receiv just the on which the router decid is logic closest in the network anycast address is an inher featur of onli ipv in ipv anycast address implement typic oper us the shortest path metric of bgp rout and do not take into account congest or other attribut of the path anycast method ar us for global load balanc and ar commonli us in distribut dn system public address a public ip address in common parlanc is synonym with a global routabl unicast ip address citat need both ipv and ipv defin address rang that ar reserv for privat network and link local address the term public ip address often us exclud these type of address modif to ip address ip block and firewal firewal perform internet protocol block to protect network from unauthor access thei ar common on todai updat s internet thei control access to network base on the ip address of a client comput whether us a blacklist or a whitelist the ip address that is block is the perceiv ip address of the client mean that if the client is us a proxi server or network address translat block on ip address mai block mani individu comput ip address translat multipl client devic can appear to share ip address either becaus thei ar part of a share host web server environ or becaus an ipv network address translat nat or proxi server act as an intermediari agent on behalf of it custom in which case the real origin ip address might be hidden from the server receiv a request a common practic is to have a nat hide a larg number of ip address in a privat network onli the outsid interfac s of the nat need to have internet routabl address most commonli the nat devic map tcp or udp port number on the side of the larger public network to individu privat address on the masquerad network in small home network nat function ar usual implement in a residenti gatewai devic typic on market as a router in thi scenario the comput connect to the router would have privat ip address and the router would have a public address to commun on the internet thi type of router allow sever comput to share on public ip address diagnost tool comput
