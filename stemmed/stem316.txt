inconsist syntax and semant edit overal structur edit an eiffel system or program is a collect of class abov the level of class eiffel defin cluster which is essenti a group of class and possibl of subclust nest cluster cluster ar not a syntact languag construct but rather a standard organiz convent typic an eiffel program will be organ with each class in a separ file and each cluster in a directori contain class file in thi organ subclust ar subdirectori for exampl under standard organiz and case convent x e might be the name of a file that defin a class call x a class contain featur which ar similar to routin member attribut or method in other object orient program languag a class also defin it invari and contain other properti such as a note section for document and metadata eiffel s standard data type such as integ string and arrai ar all themselv class everi system must have a class design as root with on of it creation procedur design as root procedur execut a system consist of creat an instanc of the root class and execut it root procedur gener do so creat new object call new featur and so on eiffel ha five basic execut instruct assign object creation routin call condit and iter eiffel s control structur ar strict in enforc structur program everi block ha exactli on entri and exactli on exit scope edit unlik mani object orient languag but like smalltalk eiffel doe not permit ani assign into field of object except within the featur of an object which is the practic applic of the principl of inform hide or data abstract requir formal interfac for data mutat to put it in the languag of other object orient program languag all eiffel field ar privat and setter ar need to modifi valu an upshot of thi is that setter can and normal do implement the invari for which eiffel provid syntax while eiffel doe not allow direct access to the featur of a class by a client of the class it doe allow for the definit of an assign command such as some attribut some type assign set some attribut set some attribut v valu type set valu of some attribut to v do some attribut v end while a slight bow to the overal develop commun to allow someth look like direct access e g therebi break the inform hide principl the practic is danger as it hide or obfusc the realiti of a setter be us in practic it is better to read the direct call to a setter rather than impli a direct access to a featur like some attribut as in the exampl code abov unlik other languag have notion of public privat and so on eiffel us an export technolog to more precis control the scope between client and supplier class moreov the export logic us can be check static by the compil which allow earlier detect of scope violat call at compil time rather than run time for exampl below the none is similar to privat in other languag scope appli thi wai to a featur set e g everyth below the featur keyword to either the next featur set keyword or the end of the class can be chang in descend class us the export keyword featur none initi default creat initi a new zero decim instanc do make zero end altern the lack of a x export declar impli ani and is similar to the public scope of other languag featur constant final scope can be select and precis control to ani class in the eiffel project univers such as featur decim dcm ma decim parser dcm ma decim handler access here the compil will allow onli the class list between the curli brace to access the featur within the featur group e g decim dcm ma decim parser dcm ma decim handler hello world edit a program languag s look and feel is often convei us a hello world program such a program written in eiffel might be class hello world creat make featur make do print hello world n end end thi program contain the class hello world the constructor creat routin for the class name make invok the print system librari routin to write a hello world messag to the output design by contract edit main articl design by contract the concept of design by contract is central to eiffel the contract assert what must be true befor a routin is execut precondit and what must hold to be true after the routin finish post condit class invari contract defin what assert must hold true both befor and after ani featur of a class is access both routin and attribut moreov contract codifi into execut code develop and design assumpt about the oper environ of the featur of a class or the class as a whole by mean of the invari the eiffel compil is design to includ the featur and class contract in variou level eiffelstudio for exampl execut all featur and class contract dure execut in the workbench mode when an execut is creat the compil is instruct by wai of the project set file e g ecf file to either includ or exclud ani set of contract thu an execut file can be compil to either includ or exclud ani level of contract therebi bring along continu level of unit and integr test moreov contract can be continu and method exercis by wai of the auto test featur found in eiffelstudio the design by contract mechan ar tightli integr with the languag and guid redefinit of featur in inherit routin precondit the precondit mai onli be weaken by inherit ani call that meet the requir of the ancestor meet those of the descend routin postcondit the postcondit can onli be strengthen by inherit ani result guarante by the ancestor is still provid by the descend class invari condit that must hold true both befor except befor creation and after except post destroi access to a class featur routin or attribut becaus the invari is check so often it make it simultan the most expens and most power form of condit or contract in addit the languag support a check instruct a kind of assert and loop invari void safeti edit void safeti like static type is anoth facil for improv softwar qualiti void safe softwar is protect from run time error caus by call to void refer and therefor will be more reliabl than softwar in which call to void target can occur the analog to static type is a us on in fact void safe capabl could be seen as an extens to the type system or a step beyond static type becaus the mechan for ensur void safeti is integr into the type system the guard against void target call can be seen by wai of the notion of attach and by extens detach e g detach keyword the void safe facil can be seen in a short re work of the exampl code us abov some attribut detach some type us some attribut set valu of some attribut to v do if attach some attribut as l attribut then do someth l attribut end end do someth a valu some type do someth with a valu do do someth with a valu end the code exampl abov show how the compil can static address the reliabl of whether some attribut will be attach or detach at the point it is us notabl the attach keyword allow for an attach local e g l attribut which is scope to onli the block of code enclos by the if statement construct thu within thi small block of code the local variabl e g l attribut can be static guarante to be non void i e void safe featur command and queri edit the primari characterist of a class is that it defin a set of featur as a class repres a set of run time object or instanc a featur is an oper on these object there ar two kind of featur queri and command a queri provid inform about an instanc a command modifi an instanc the command queri distinct is import to the eiffel method in particular uniform access principl from the point of view of a softwar client make a call to a class featur whether a queri is an attribut field valu or a function comput valu should not make ani differ for exampl a vehicl speed could be an attribut access on the object a vehicl or it could be comput by a function that divid distanc by time the notat is the same in both case so that it is easi to chang the class s implement without affect client softwar command queri separ principl queri must not modifi the instanc thi is not a languag rule but a methodolog principl so in good eiffel style on doe not find get function that chang someth and return a result instead there ar command procedur to chang object and queri to obtain inform about the object result from preced chang overload edit eiffel doe not allow argument overload each featur name within a class alwai map to a specif featur within the class on name within on class mean on thing thi design choic help the readabl of class by avoid a caus of ambigu about which routin will be invok by a call it also simplifi the languag mechan in particular thi is what make eiffel s multipl inherit mechan possibl name can of cours be reus in differ class for exampl the featur plu along with it infix alia is defin in sever class integ real string etc gener edit see also gener program gener in eiffel a gener class is a class that vari by type e g list phone a list of phone number account g account type allow for account save and account check etc class can be gener to express that thei ar parameter by type gener paramet appear in squar bracket class list g g is known as a formal gener paramet eiffel reserv argument for routin and us paramet onli for gener class with such a declar g repres within the class an arbitrari type so a function can return a valu of type g and a routin can take an argument of that type item g do end put x g do end the list integ and list word ar gener deriv of thi class permit combin with n integ w word il list integ wl list word ar n il item wl put w integ and word ar the actual gener paramet in these gener deriv it is also possibl to have constrain formal paramet for which the actual paramet must inherit from a given class the constraint for exampl in class hash tabl g kei hashabl a deriv hash tabl integ string is valid onli if string inherit from hashabl as it inde doe in typic eiffel librari within the class have kei constrain by hashabl mean that for x kei it is possibl to appli to x all the featur of hashabl as in x hash code inherit basic edit to inherit from on or more other a class will includ an inherit claus at the begin class c inherit a b rest of class declar the class mai redefin overrid some or all of the inherit featur thi must be explicitli announc at the begin of the class through a redefin subclaus of the inherit claus as in class c inherit a redefin f g h end b redefin u v end see for a complet discuss of eiffel inherit defer class and featur edit class mai be defin with defer class rather than with class to indic that the class mai not be directli instanti non instantiat class ar call abstract class in some other object orient program languag in eiffel parlanc onli an effect class can be instanti it mai be a descend of a defer class a featur can also be defer by us the defer keyword in place of a do claus if a class ha ani defer featur it must be declar as defer howev a class with no defer featur mai nonetheless itself be defer defer class plai some of the same role as interfac in languag such as java though mani object orient program theorist believ interfac ar themselv larg an answer to java s lack of multipl inherit which eiffel ha renam edit a class that inherit from on or more other get all it featur by default under their origin name it mai howev chang their name through renam claus thi is requir in the case of multipl inherit if there ar name clash between inherit featur without renam the result class would violat the no overload principl note abov and henc would be invalid tupl edit tupl type mai be view as a simpl form of class provid onli attribut and the correspond setter procedur a typic tupl type read tupl name string weight real date date and could be us to describ a simpl notion of birth record if a class is not need an instanc of such a tupl is simpli a sequenc of valu with the given type given in bracket such as brigitt last night compon of such a tupl can be access as if the tupl tag were attribut of a class for exampl if t ha been assign the abov tupl then t weight ha valu thank to the notion of assign command see below dot notat can also be us to assign compon of such a tupl as in t weight t weight the tupl tag ar option so that it is also possibl to write a tupl type as tupl string real date in some compil thi is the onli form of tupl as tag were introduc with the ecma standard the precis specif of e g tupl a b c is that it describ sequenc of at least three element the first three be of type a b c respect as a result tupl a b c conform to mai be assign to tupl a b to tupl a and to tupl without paramet the topmost tupl type to which all tupl type conform agent edit eiffel s agent mechan wrap oper into object thi mechan can be us for iter event driven program and other context in which it is us to pass oper around the program structur other program languag especi on that emphas function program allow a similar pattern us continu closur or gener eiffel s agent emphas the languag s object orient paradigm and us a syntax and semant similar to code block in smalltalk and rubi for exampl to execut the my action block for each element of my list on would write my list do all agent my action to execut my action onli on element satisfi my condit a limit filter can be ad my list do if agent my action agent my condit in these exampl my action and my condit ar routin prefix them with agent yield an object that repres the correspond routin with all it properti in particular the abil to be call with the appropri argument so if a repres that object for exampl becaus a is the argument to do all the instruct a call x will call the origin routin with the argument x as if we had directli call the origin routin my action x argument to call ar pass as a tupl here x it is possibl to keep some argument to an agent open and make other close the open argument ar pass as argument to call thei ar provid at the time of agent us the close argument ar provid at the time of agent definit for exampl if action ha two argument the iter my list do all agent action y iter action x y for success valu of x where the second argument remain set to y the question mark indic an open argument y is a close argument of the agent note that the basic syntax agent f is a shorthand for agent f with all argument open it is also possibl to make the target of an agent open through the notat t where t is the type of the target the distinct between open and close operand operand argument target correspond to the distinct between bound and free variabl in lambda calculu an agent express such as action y with some operand close and some open correspond to a version of the origin oper curri on the close operand the agent mechan also allow defin an agent without refer to an exist routin such as my action my condit action through inlin agent as in my list do all agent s string requir not void s void do s append charact ensur append s count old s count end the inlin agent pass here can have all the trap of a normal routin includ precondit postcondit rescu claus not us here and a full signatur thi avoid defin routin when all that s need is a comput to be wrap in an agent thi is us in particular for contract as in an invari claus that express that all element of a list ar posit my list for all agent x integ boolean do result x end the current agent mechan leav a possibl of run time type error if a routin with n argument is pass to an agent expect m argument with m n thi can be avoid by a run time check through the precondit valid argument of call sever propos for a pure static correct of thi problem ar avail includ a languag chang propos by ribet et al onc routin edit a routin s result can be cach us the onc keyword in place of do non first call to a routin requir no addit comput or resourc alloc but simpli return a previous comput result a common pattern for onc function is to provid share object the first call will creat the object subsequ on will return the refer to that object the typic scheme is share object some type onc creat result make arg thi creat the object and return a refer to it through result end the return object result in the exampl can itself be mutabl but it refer remain the same often onc routin perform a requir initi multipl call to a librari can includ a call to the initi procedur but onli the first such call will perform the requir action us thi pattern initi can be decentr avoid the need for a special initi modul onc routin ar similar in purpos and effect to the singleton pattern in mani program languag and to the borg pattern us in python by default a onc routin is call onc per thread the semant can be adjust to onc per process or onc per object by qualifi it with a onc kei e g onc process convers edit eiffel provid a mechan to allow convers between variou type the mechan coexist with inherit and complement it to avoid ani confus between the two mechan the design enforc the follow principl convers principl a type mai not both conform and convert to anoth for exampl newspap mai conform to public but integ convert to real and doe not inherit from it the convers mechan simpli gener the ad hoc convers rule such as inde between integ and real that exist in most program languag make them applic to ani type as long as the abov principl is observ for exampl a date class mai be declar to convert to string thi make it possibl to creat a string from a date simpli through my string my date as a shortcut for us an explicit object creation with a convers procedur creat my string make from date my date to make the first form possibl as a synonym for the second it suffic to list the creation procedur constructor make from date in a convert claus at the begin of the class as anoth exampl if there is such a convers procedur list from tupl dai integ month string year integ then on can directli assign a tupl to a date caus the appropri convers as in bastil dai juli except handl edit except handl in eiffel is base on the principl of design by contract for exampl an except occur when a routin s caller fail to satisfi a precondit or when a routin cannot ensur a promis postcondit in eiffel except handl is not us for control flow or to correct data input mistak an eiffel except handler is defin us the rescu keyword within the rescu section the retri keyword execut the routin again for exampl the follow routin track the number of attempt at execut the routin and onli retri a certain number of time connect to server server socket connect to a server or give up after attempt requir server void and then server address void local attempt integ do server connect ensur connect server is connect rescu if attempt then attempt attempt retri end end thi exampl is arguabl flaw for anyth but the simplest program howev becaus connect failur is to be expect for most program a routin name like attempt connect to server would be better and the postcondit would not promis a connect leav it up to the caller to take appropri step if the connect wa not open concurr edit a number of network and thread librari ar avail such as eiffelnet and eiffelthread a concurr model for eiffel base on the concept of design by contract is scoop or simpl concurr object orient program not yet part of the offici languag definit but avail in eiffelstudio cameo is an unimpl variat of scoop for eiffel concurr also interact with except asynchron except can be troublesom where a routin rais an except after it caller ha itself finish oper and bracket syntax assign command edit eiffel s view of comput is complet object orient in the sens that everi oper is rel to an object the target so for exampl an addit such as a b is conceptu understood as if it were the method call a plu b with target a featur plu and argument b of cours the former is the convent syntax and usual prefer oper syntax make it possibl to us either form by declar the featur for exampl in integ but thi appli to other basic class and can be us in ani other for which such an oper appropri plu alia other integ integ normal function declar end the rang of oper that can be us as alia is quit broad thei includ predefin oper such as but also free oper made of non alphanumer symbol thi make it possibl to design special infix and prefix notat for exampl in mathemat and physic applic everi class mai in addit have on function alias to the bracket oper allow the notat a i as a

semicolon is just omit except to separ multipl instruct on a line thi result in less clutter on the program page there is no nest of featur and class declar as a result the structur of an eiffel class is simpl some class level claus inherit invari and a success of featur declar all at the same level it is customari to group featur into separ featur claus for more readabl with a standard set of
