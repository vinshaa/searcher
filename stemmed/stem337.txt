second of the critic five year of the initi composit of die welt al will und vorstellung a kei focu of schopenhau wa hi investig of individu motiv befor schopenhau hegel had popular the concept of zeitgeist the idea that societi consist of a collect conscious which move in a distinct direct dictat the action of it member schopenhau a reader of both kant and hegel critic their logic optim and the belief that individu moral could be determin by societi and reason schopenhau believ that human were motiv by onli their own basic desir or will zum leben will to live which direct all of mankind for schopenhau human desir wa futil illog directionless and by extens so wa all human action in the world he wrote man can inde do what he want but he cannot will what he want in thi sens he adher to the fichtean principl of ideal the world is for a subject thi ideal so present immedi commit it to an ethic attitud unlik the pure epistemolog concern of descart and berkelei to schopenhau the will is a malign metaphys exist which control not onli the action of individu intellig agent but ultim all observ phenomena an evil to be termin via mankind s duti ascetic and chastiti he is credit with on of the most famou open line of philosophi the world is my represent will for schopenhau is what kant call the thing in itself nietzsch wa greatli influenc by thi idea of will while develop it in a differ direct art and aesthet edit main articl arthur schopenhau s aesthet for schopenhau human desir will and crave caus suffer or pain a temporari wai to escap thi pain is through aesthet contempl a method compar to zapff s sublim aesthet contempl allow on to escap thi pain albeit temporarili becaus it stop on perceiv the world as mere present instead on no longer perceiv the world as an object of percept therefor as subject to the principl of suffici ground time space and causal from which on is separ rather on becom on with that percept on can thu no longer separ the perceiv from the percept the world as will and represent section from thi immers with the world on no longer view oneself as an individu who suffer in the world due to on s individu will but rather becom a subject of cognit to a percept that is pure will less timeless section where the essenc idea of the world ar shown art is the practic consequ of thi brief aesthet contempl as it attempt to depict on s immers with the world thu tri to depict the essenc pure idea of the world music for schopenhau wa the purest form of art becaus it wa the on that depict the will itself without it appear as subject to the principl of suffici ground therefor as an individu object accord to daniel albright schopenhau thought that music wa the onli art that did not mere copi idea but actual embodi the will itself he deem music to be a timeless univers languag which is comprehend everywher and can imbu global enthusiasm if in possess of a signific melodi mathemat edit schopenhau s realist view on mathemat ar evid in hi critic of the contemporari attempt to prove the parallel postul in euclidean geometri write shortli befor the logic independ of the axiom wa demonstr by the discoveri of hyperbol geometri and long befor the gener theori of rel reveal that it doe not express a properti of physic space schopenhau critic mathematician for try to prove from indirect concept that which he held to be directli evid from percept the euclidean method of demonstr ha brought forth from it own womb it most strike parodi and caricatur in the famou controversi over the theori of parallel and in the attempt repeat everi year to prove the eleventh axiom also known as the fifth postul the axiom assert and that inde through the indirect criterion of a third intersect line that two line inclin to each other for thi is the precis mean of less than two right angl if produc far enough must meet now thi truth is suppos to be too complic to pass as self evid and therefor need a proof but no such proof can be produc just becaus there is noth more immedi throughout hi write schopenhau critic the logic deriv of philosophi and mathemat from mere concept instead of from intuit percept in fact it seem to me that the logic method is in thi wai reduc to an absurd but it is precis through the controversi over thi togeth with the futil attempt to demonstr the directli certain as mere indirectli certain that the independ and clear of intuit evid appear in contrast with the useless and difficulti of logic proof a contrast as instruct as it is amus the direct certainti will not be admit here just becaus it is no mere logic certainti follow from the concept and thu rest sole on the relat of predic to subject accord to the principl of contradict but that eleventh axiom regard parallel line is a synthet proposit a priori and as such ha the guarante of pure not empir percept thi percept is just as immedi and certain as is the principl of contradict itself from which all proof origin deriv their certainti at bottom thi hold good of everi geometr theorem although schopenhau could see no justif for try to prove euclid s parallel postul he did see a reason for examin anoth of euclid s axiom it surpris me that the eighth axiom figur that coincid with on anoth ar equal to on anoth is not rather attack for coincid with on anoth is either a mere tautolog or someth quit empir belong not to pure intuit or percept but to extern sensuou experi thu it presuppos mobil of the figur but matter alon is movabl in space consequ thi refer to coincid with on anoth forsak pure space the sole element of geometri in order to pass over to the materi and empir thi follow kant s reason ethic edit schopenhau s moral theori propos that onli compass can drive moral act accord to schopenhau compass alon is the good of the object of the act that is thei cannot be inspir by either the prospect of person util or the feel of duti mankind can also be guid by egoism and malic egotist act ar those guid by self interest desir for pleasur or happi schopenhau believ most of our deed belong to thi class act of malic ar differ from egotist act as in the case of act of compass these do not target person util their aim is to caus damag to other independ of person gain he believ like swami vivekananda in the uniti of all with on self and also believ that ego is the origin of pain and conflict that reduct of ego frame the moral principl punish edit schopenhau accord to schopenhau whenev we make a choic we assum as necessari that decis wa preced by someth from which it ensu and which we call the ground or reason or more accur the motiv of the result action choic ar not made freeli our action ar necessari and determin becaus everi human be even everi anim after the motiv ha appear must carri out the action which alon is in accord with hi inborn and immut charact a definit action inevit result when a particular motiv influenc a person s given unchang charact the state schopenhau claim punish crimin in order to

possibl of counter motiv to all crimin action that can possibl be imagin the law and it fulfil name punish ar direct essenti to the futur not to the past thi distinguish punish from reveng for reveng is motiv by what ha happen and henc by the past as such all retali for wrong by inflict a pain without ani object for the futur is reveng and can have no other purpos than consol for the suffer on ha endur by the sight of the suffer on ha caus in anoth such a thing is wicked and cruelti and cannot be ethic justifi the object of punish is deterr from crime object and purpos for the futur distinguish punish from reveng and punish ha thi object onli when it is inflict in fulfil of a law onli in thi wai doe it proclaim itself to be inevit and infal for everi futur case and thu it obtain for the law the power to deter should capit punish be legal for safeguard the live of citizen he assert capit punish is therefor absolut necessari the murder wrote schopenhau who is condemn to death accord to the law must it is true be now us as a mere mean and with complet right for public secur which is the princip object of the state is disturb by him inde it is abolish if the law remain unfulfil the murder hi life hi person must be the mean of fulfil the law and thu of re establish public secur schopenhau disagre with those who would abolish capit punish those who would like to abolish it should be given the answer first remov murder from the world and then capit punish ought to follow peopl accord to schopenhau cannot be improv thei can onli be influenc by strong motiv that overpow crimin motiv schopenhau declar that real moral reform is not at all possibl but onli deter from the deed he claim that thi doctrin wa not origin with him previous it appear in the write of plato seneca hobb pufendorf and anselm feuerbach schopenhau declar that their teach wa corrupt by subsequ error and therefor wa in need of clarif god edit even though schopenhau end hi treatis on the freedom of human will with the postul of everyon s respons for their charact and consequ act the respons follow from on s be the will as noumenon from which also all the charact and creation come he consid hi view incompat with theism on ground of fatal and more gener respons for evil in schopenhau s philosophi the dogma of christian lose their signific and the last judgment is no longer preced by anyth the world is itself the last judgment on it wherea god if he exist would be evil psycholog edit philosoph have not tradition been impress by the tribul of sex but schopenhau address it and relat concept forthrightli on ought rather to be surpris that a thing sex which plai throughout so import a part in human life ha hitherto practic been disregard by philosoph altogeth and li befor us as raw and untreat materi he gave a name to a forc within man which he felt had invari preced over reason the will to live or will to life will zum leben defin as an inher drive within human be and inde all creatur to stai aliv a forc which inveigl us into reproduc schopenhau refus to conceiv of love as either trifl or accident but rather understood it to be an immens power forc ly unseen within

comment in hi parerga and paralipomena and manuscript remain schopenhau describ himself as a propon of limit govern what wa essenti he thought wa that the state should leav each man free to work out hi own salvat and so long as govern wa thu limit he would prefer to be rule by a lion than on of hi fellow rat i e by a monarch rather than a democrat schopenhau share the view of thoma hobb on the

the great secret he wa so impress by their philosophi that he call them the product of the highest human wisdom and consid them to contain superhuman concept the upanishad wa a great sourc of inspir to schopenhau and write about them he said it is the most satisfi and elev read with the except of the origin text which is possibl in the world it ha been the solac of my life and will be the solac of my death it is well known that the book oupnekhat upanishad alwai lai open on hi tabl and he invari studi it befor sleep at night he call the open up of sanskrit literatur the greatest gift of our

nobl truth of buddhism similar center on the principl that life involv suffer that suffer is caus by desir ta h and that the extinct of desir lead to liber thu three of the four truth of the buddha correspond to schopenhau s doctrin of the will in buddhism howev while greed and lust ar alwai unskil desir is ethic variabl it can be skill unskil or neutral for schopenhau will had ontolog primaci over the intellect in other word desir is understood to be prior to thought schopenhau felt thi wa similar to notion of puru rtha or goal of life in ved nta hinduism in schopenhau s philosophi denial of the will is attain by either person experi of an extrem great suffer that lead to loss of the will to live orknowledg of the essenti natur of life in the world through observ of the suffer of other peopl howev buddhist nirv a is not equival to the condit that schopenhau describ as denial of the will nirv a is not the extinguish of the person as some western scholar have thought but onli the extinguish the liter mean of nirvana of the flame of greed hatr and delus that assail a person s charact occult historian joscelyn godwin state it wa buddhism that inspir the philosophi of arthur

thi number far more follow than ani other and thi agreement must be yet the more pleas to me inasmuch as in my philosoph i have certainli not been under it influenc emphasi ad for up till when my work

appear frequent in schopenhau s write as note abov he appreci the teach of the buddha and even call himself a buddhist he said that hi philosophi could not have been conceiv befor these teach were avail concern the upanishad and veda he write in the world as will and represent if the reader ha also receiv the benefit of the veda the access to which by mean of the upanishad is in my ey the
