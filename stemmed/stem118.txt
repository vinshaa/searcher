earli develop edit ken thompson left with denni ritchi right the inventor of the c program languag the origin of c is close ti to the develop of the unix oper system origin implement in assembl

declar thi section need addit citat for verif pleas help improv thi articl by ad citat to reliabl sourc unsourc materi mai be challeng and remov octob the type system in c is static and weakli type which make it similar to the type system of algol descend such as pascal although c is unrel to algol there ar built in type for integ of variou size both sign and unsign float point number charact and enumer type enum c ad a boolean datatyp there ar also deriv type includ arrai pointer record struct and untag union union c is often us in low level system program where escap from the type system mai be necessari the compil attempt to ensur type correct of most express but the programm can overrid the check in variou wai either by us a type cast to explicitli convert a valu from on type to anoth or by us pointer or union to reinterpret the underli bit of a data object in some other wai some find c s declar syntax unintuit particularli for function pointer ritchi s idea wa to declar identifi in context resembl their us declar reflect us c s usual arithmet convers allow for effici code to be gener but can sometim produc unexpect result for exampl a comparison of sign and unsign integ of equal width requir a convers of the sign valu to unsign thi can gener unexpect result if the sign valu is neg pointer edit c support the us of pointer a type of refer that record the address or locat of an object or function in memori pointer can be dereferenc to access data store at the address point to or to invok a point to function pointer can be manipul us assign or pointer arithmet the run time represent of a pointer valu is typic a raw memori address perhap augment by an offset within word field but sinc a pointer s type includ the type of the thing point to express includ pointer can be type check at compil time pointer arithmet is automat scale by the size of the point to data type pointer ar us for mani purpos in c text string ar commonli manipul us pointer into arrai of charact dynam memori alloc is perform us pointer mani data type such as tree ar commonli implement as dynam alloc struct object link togeth us pointer pointer to function ar us for pass function as argument to higher order function such as qsort or bsearch or as callback to be invok by event handler a null pointer valu explicitli point to no valid locat dereferenc a null pointer valu is undefin often result in a segment fault null pointer valu ar us for indic special case such as no next pointer in the final node of a link list or as an error indic from function return pointer in appropri context in sourc code such as for assign to a pointer variabl a null pointer constant can be written as with or without explicit cast to a pointer type or as the null macro defin by sever standard header in condit context null pointer valu evalu to fals while all other pointer valu evalu to true void pointer void point to object of unspecifi type and can therefor be us as gener data pointer sinc the size and type of the point to object is not known void pointer cannot be dereferenc nor is pointer arithmet on them allow although thei can easili be and in mani context implicitli ar convert to and from ani other object pointer type careless us of pointer is potenti danger becaus thei ar typic uncheck a pointer variabl can be made to point to ani arbitrari locat which can caus undesir effect although properli us pointer point to safe place thei can be made to point to unsaf place by us invalid pointer arithmet the object thei point to mai be dealloc and reus dangl pointer thei mai be us without have been initi wild pointer or thei mai be directli assign an unsaf valu us a cast union or through anoth corrupt pointer in gener c is permiss in allow manipul of and convers between pointer type although compil typic provid option for variou level of check some other program languag address these problem by us more restrict refer type arrai edit see also c string arrai type in c ar tradition of a fix static size specifi at compil time the more recent c standard also allow a form of variabl length arrai howev it is also possibl to alloc a block of memori of arbitrari size at run time us the standard librari s malloc function and treat it as an arrai c s unif of arrai and pointer mean that declar arrai and these dynam alloc simul arrai ar virtual interchang sinc arrai ar alwai access in effect via pointer arrai access ar typic not check against the underli arrai size although some compil mai provid bound check as an option arrai bound violat ar therefor possibl and rather common in carelessli written code and can lead to variou repercuss includ illeg memori access corrupt of data buffer overrun and run time except if bound check is desir it must be done manual c doe not have a special provis for declar multidimension arrai but rather reli on recurs within the type system to declar arrai of arrai which effect accomplish the same thing the index valu of the result multidimension arrai can be thought of as increas in row major order multidimension arrai ar commonli us in numer algorithm mainli from appli linear algebra to store matric the structur of the c arrai is well suit to thi particular task howev sinc arrai ar pass mere as pointer the bound of the arrai must be known fix valu or els explicitli pass to ani subroutin that requir them and dynam size arrai of arrai cannot be access us doubl index a workaround for thi is to alloc the arrai with an addit row vector of pointer to the column c introduc variabl length arrai which address some but not all of the issu with ordinari c arrai arrai pointer interchang edit the subscript notat x i where x design a pointer is a syntact sugar for x i take advantag of the compil s knowledg of the pointer type the address that x i point to is not the base address point to by x increment by i byte but rather is defin to be the base address increment by i multipli by the size of an element that x point to thu x i design the i th element of the arrai furthermor in most express context a notabl except is as operand of sizeof the name of an arrai is automat convert to a pointer to the arrai s first element thi impli that an arrai is never copi as a whole when name as an argument to a function but rather onli the address of it first element is pass therefor although function call in c us pass by valu semant arrai ar in effect pass by refer the size of an element can be determin by appli the oper sizeof to ani dereferenc element of x as in n sizeof x or n sizeof x and the number of element in a declar arrai a can be determin as sizeof a sizeof a the latter onli appli to arrai name variabl declar with subscript int a due to the semant of c it is not possibl to determin the entir size of arrai through pointer to arrai or those creat by dynam alloc malloc code such as sizeof arr sizeof arr where arr a design a pointer will not work sinc the compil assum the size of the pointer itself is be request sinc arrai name argument to sizeof ar not convert to pointer thei do not exhibit such ambigu howev arrai creat by dynam alloc ar initi to pointer rather than true arrai variabl so thei suffer from the same sizeof issu as arrai pointer thu despit thi appar equival between arrai and pointer variabl there is still a distinct to be made between them even though the name of an arrai is in most express context convert into a pointer to it first element thi pointer doe not itself occupi ani storag the arrai name is not an l valu and it address is a constant unlik a pointer variabl consequ what an arrai point to cannot be chang and it is imposs to assign a new address to an arrai name arrai content mai be copi howev by us the memcpi function or by access the individu element memori manag edit on of the most import function of a program languag is to provid facil for manag memori and the object that ar store in memori c provid three distinct wai to alloc memori for object static memori alloc space for the object is provid in the binari at compil time these object have an extent or lifetim as long as the binari which contain them is load into memori automat memori alloc temporari object can be store on the stack and thi space is automat freed and reusabl after the block in which thei ar declar is exit dynam memori alloc block of memori of arbitrari size can be request at run time us librari function such as malloc from a region of memori call the heap these block persist until subsequ freed for reus by call the librari function realloc or free these three approach ar appropri in differ situat and have variou tradeoff for exampl static memori alloc ha littl alloc overhead automat alloc mai involv slightli more overhead and dynam memori alloc can potenti have a great deal of overhead for both alloc and dealloc the persist natur of static object is us for maintain state inform across function call automat alloc is easi to us but stack space is typic much more limit and transient than either static memori or heap space and dynam memori alloc allow conveni alloc of object whose size is known onli at run time most c program make extens us of all three where possibl automat or static alloc is usual simplest becaus the storag is manag by the compil free the programm of the potenti error prone chore of manual alloc and releas storag howev mani data structur can chang in size at runtim and sinc static alloc and automat alloc befor c must have a fix size at compil time there ar mani situat in which dynam alloc is necessari prior to the c standard variabl size arrai were a common exampl of thi see the articl on malloc for an exampl of dynam alloc arrai unlik automat alloc which can fail at run time with uncontrol consequ the dynam alloc function return an indic in the form of a null pointer valu when the requir storag cannot be alloc static alloc that is too larg is usual detect by the linker or loader befor the program can even begin execut unless otherwis specifi static object contain zero or null pointer valu upon program startup automat and dynam alloc object ar initi onli if an initi valu is explicitli specifi otherwis thei initi have indetermin valu typic whatev bit pattern happen to be present in the storag which might not even repres a valid valu for that type if the program attempt to access an uniniti valu the result ar undefin mani modern compil try to detect and warn about thi problem but both fals posit and fals neg can occur anoth issu is that heap memori alloc ha to be synchron with it actual usag in ani program in order for it to be reus as much as possibl for exampl if the onli pointer to a heap memori alloc goe out of scope or ha it valu overwritten befor free is call then that memori cannot be recov for later reus and is essenti lost to the program a phenomenon known as a memori leak convers it is possibl for memori to be freed but continu to be referenc lead to unpredict result typic the symptom will appear in a portion of the program far remov from the actual error make it difficult to track down the problem such issu ar amelior in languag
