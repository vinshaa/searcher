it to wsdl soap thi is actual not true the complet cite from the w c ws glossari explicit name wsdl and soap the introduct should be reformul to avoid thi impress zefiro februari utc the definit w c what is a web servic is poor sinc it defin in on sentenc and then clarifi in the other that it should util wsdl and soap it also state that a web servic doe not requir http or xml i m also not sure how well defin web relat standard is it should instead be word to sai what the object of a web servic a softwar system design to support interoper machin to machin interact over a network and then defin it by how it accomplish thi object by us wsdl xml soap http etc mai utc the editor of thi articl need to make a choic if the editor ar go to insist that thi page is about web servic as defin by the w c quot in the first sentenc e g w c what is a web servic then wikipedia is miss an articl on what ar refer to as web api or web servic if the editor decid that web servic is an inclus term then the intro sentenc should be replac and there should be a page on soap wsdl web servic if there isn t alreadi also if the second choic the technic level of thi articl is too high i would propos that neither answer is complet correct but that either choic is better than the current state of thing esp sinc wikipedia is miss a layman s explan of web api and how thei differ from web page boypros talk septemb utc i agre boypros anyon and everyon is the editor of an articl so in revis i tri to solv the gener specif problem by split the web servic architectur s definit quotat into gener and the wsa specif version i think thi help we ll see if it surviv my editori that few web servic actual implement the wsa definit need a citat perhap the gener definit could just link to web api and or the

level descript of soap and rest and thi is the best preced unsign comment ad by javaman talk contrib januari utc outdat edit thi articl sai that in common usag a web servic is soap base i think that wa true a few year ago but more and more the common understand is that a web servic is a servic access from the web i e via http thi seem to me to be the simplest definit and the most fit as evid i offer amazon web servic aw which provid both soap and non soap version of their servic if a web servic must us soap then it would be improp for amazon to call these rest interfac web servic it s pretti plain to me that make soap a requir of web servic is a pointless distinct a lot of organ ar treat soap as a legaci protocol person i call soap xml corba i also don t understand the character of rest as emul http afaik rest is defin in term of http it s not emul the four oper of http get put post delet it s built on top of them dubwai talk januari utc i see your point perhap it should be

should start with some disambigu a web servic is just a gener term for some kind of network servic that us the web a web servic is the standard built on soap i agre but the gener specif split is not base on whether web servic is capit i split the start quotat in revis which help skierpag talk august utc soa web servic rest edit thi articl is a mess whoever wrote it doesn t seem to understand web servic at all there ar two kind of web servic rpc and roa resourc orient architectur rpc offer servic ie verb method and roa offer noun xml json for exampl rpc is typic associ with soap henc the name simpl object access protocol which access object on the server to invok their member function it is similar to corba roa is typic associ with rest henc the name roa grab a represent of content which is on the server and transfer it to the client it is similar to the rest of the web i start to fix the articl but it is so mess up it realli requir a total rewrit i ve never seen a technic articl on wikipedia which is so uninform polit articl ar alwai a mess but i alwai thought wikipedia did a fairli good job of technic content talk januari utc i agre with you the articl is a mess try to make sens of what web servic ar from read it is not easi the most fundament error is that it doe not explain the purpos of web servic which if i understand it correctli is as simpl as machin machin commun on the web instead of man machin thi need to be point out befor ani of the technic detail is present i unfortun do not have suffic knowledg on the subject happi to review fact check etc though gosub talk march utc i agre also that the articl is poor it doesn t address the predomin type of web servic in us todai which is the basi of most mashup i think the problem is that the three class of web servic rpc soa rest ar not mutual exclus nor even at the same level soa is too broad and is us as a catchal for soap wsdl and other ws technolog talli anoth vote for a rework of the articl also neither soa nor rest ar a class of web servic soa and rest ar architectur style soa doe not prescrib the us of soap soa soap rest doe not prescrib the us of http and doe not defin ani verb at all it simpli us http and it verb as an exemplar for adher to the rest architectur constraint rest http reamon talk decemb utc while i agre that soa soap you can have web servic over other transport rest http is a bit mislead though true for rest in gener rest web servic do need to run over http q chri talk march utc evolut edit i see some support for a complet rewrit of thi articl it is a fairli import topic but it is import to keep vendor implement bia out of it the current articl is pretti good about that i would guess that most peopl that can contribut substanti will have experi with onli a limit rang of the avail technolog i propos chang thing in stage identifi major ax that can be us to partit what is a web servic from what isn t and what separ differ approach these can be ad in as new section cannib the old on as need to keep everyth consist connect in that vein i m start with minor chang to more accur describ the section on design methodolog which is actual describ autom design methodolog srjefferi talk januari utc an articl for those who alreadi know what a web servic is edit i m studi comput scienc but still think that thi articl explain next to noth the first sentenc is a web servic is a method of commun between two electron devic over a network can it be us for ani kind of commun ping is a form of commun is a web servic then the prefer wai to do a ping email is certainli commun do i us web servic everi time i email someon what most peopl would want to know is probabl what kind of commun it refer to and what is transmit also is there a server and a client or is it peer to peer is the commun initi by the user or is thi someth done in the background do you have to know about it to us it or do the program us it without the user s knowledg read on we find other system interact with the web servic in a manner prescrib by it descript us soap messag a few sentenc later okai so now it s no longer a method but rather a comput and soap is the method but probabl not becaus later on it sai web servic ar a set of tool that can be us in a number of wai a perfectli non inform sentenc by the wai my point is that i still have no clue what the whole concept is about let me know if i m just too stupid to understand it but otherwis i hope someon can rewrit at least the introduct someon other than me that is talk march utc i m also a cs student and i agre with the abov i could not realli make much of the articl talk januari utc quit what is a web servic fli talk mai utc the problem with a lot of thi is that a web servic should be defin as a servic provid on the web it s extrem broad but accur contrari to what thi articl impli and the name convent of w within wsdl etc a servic is an abstract concept of provid some type of function or perform oper to satisfi a request you mai easili compar it to a restaur waitress or ga station attend a web servic is not a method of commun nor is a web servic an interfac for how you submit a request or receiv a repli contrari to wsdl mean web servic definit languag those ar interfac definit for how you must commun with a web servic i would also exclud the act of receiv the request and the act of transmit the repli from the definit of web servic and rather limit the servic to be the process of the request and the gener of the repli albeit everi servic need not process request or gener repli return to the restaur waitress exampl the servic provid is all the action between includ take your food order and deliv your food and fulfil ani other request you mai have the servic provid by the waitress is definit not the waitress dictat how you must commun with her which is what wsdl and other interfac definit languag do mojodaddi talk mai utc exampl edit mayb a few exampl would help
