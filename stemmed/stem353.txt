that shall last for the durat of the program static storag durat object ar initi in two phase first static initi is perform and onli after all static initi is perform dynam initi is perform static initi all object ar first initi with zero after that all object that have a constant initi phase ar initi with the constant express i e variabl initi with a liter or constexpr though it is not specifi in the standard thi phase can be complet at compil time and save in the data partit of the execut dynam initi all object initi that is done via a constructor or function call unless the function is mark with constexpr in c the dynam initi order is defin as the order of declar within the compil unit i e the same file no guarante ar provid about the order of initi between compil unit thread storag durat object edit variabl of thi type ar veri similar to static storag durat object the main differ is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruct is done after the thread ha been join automat storag durat object edit the most common variabl type in c ar local variabl insid a function or block and temporari variabl the common featur about automat variabl is that thei have a lifetim that is limit to the scope of the variabl thei ar creat and potenti initi at the point of declar see below for detail and destroi in the revers order of creation when the scope is left local variabl ar creat as the point of execut pass the declar point if the variabl ha a constructor or initi thi is us to defin the initi state of the object local variabl ar destroi when the local block or function that thei ar declar in is close c destructor for local variabl ar call at the end of the object lifetim allow a disciplin for automat resourc manag term raii which is wide us in c member variabl ar creat when the parent object is creat arrai member ar initi from to the last member of the arrai in order member variabl ar destroi when the parent object is destroi in the revers order of

resourc acquisit is initi raii concept encapsul edit encapsul is the hide of inform to ensur that data structur and oper ar us as intend and to make the usag model more obviou to the develop c provid the abil to defin class and function as it primari encapsul mechan within a class member can be declar as either public protect or privat to explicitli enforc encapsul a public member of the class is access to ani function a privat member is access onli to function that ar member of that class and to function and class explicitli grant access permiss by the class friend a protect member is access to member of class that inherit from the class in addit to the class itself and ani friend the oo principl is that all of the function and onli the function that access the intern represent of a type should be encapsul within the type definit c support thi via member function and friend function but doe not enforc it the programm can declar part or all of the represent of a type to be public and is allow to make public entiti that ar not part of the represent of the type therefor c support not just oo program but other weaker decomposit paradigm like modular program it is gener consid good practic to make all data privat or protect and to make public onli those function that ar part of a minim interfac for user of the class thi can hide the detail of data implement allow the design to later fundament chang the implement without chang the interfac in ani wai inherit edit inherit allow on data type to acquir properti of other data type inherit from a base class mai be declar as

virtual inherit virtual inherit ensur that onli on instanc of a base class exist in the inherit graph avoid some of the ambigu problem of multipl inherit multipl inherit is a c featur not found in most other languag allow a class to be deriv from more than on base class thi allow for more elabor inherit relationship for exampl a fly cat class can inherit from both cat and fly mammal some other languag such as c or java accomplish someth similar although more limit by allow inherit of multipl interfac while restrict the number of base class to on interfac unlik class provid onli declar of

with differ argument i e ad hoc polymorph the function ar distinguish by the number or type of their formal paramet thu the same function name can refer to differ function depend on the context in which it is us the type return by the function is not us to distinguish overload function and would result in a compil time error messag when declar a function a programm can specifi for on or more

there ar declar paramet explicit argument ar match to paramet in left to right order with ani unmatch paramet at the end of the paramet list be assign their default argument in mani case specifi default argument in a singl function declar is prefer to provid overload function definit with differ number of paramet templat in c provid a sophist mechan for write gener polymorph code i e parametr polymorph in particular through the curious recur templat pattern it s possibl to implement a form of static polymorph that close mimic the syntax for overrid virtual function becaus c templat ar type

code after compil with the proper compil set dynam polymorph edit inherit edit see also subtyp variabl pointer and refer to a base class type in c can refer to object of ani deriv class of that type in addit to object exactli match the variabl type thi allow arrai and other kind of contain to hold pointer to object of differ type becaus assign of valu to variabl usual occur at run time thi is necessarili a run time phenomenon c also provid a dynam cast oper which allow the program to safe attempt convers of an object into an object of a more specif object type as oppos to convers to a more gener type which is alwai allow thi featur reli on run time type inform rtti object known to be of a certain specif type can also be cast to that type with static cast a pure compil time construct that ha no runtim overhead and doe not requir rtti virtual member function edit ordinarili when a function in a deriv class overrid a function in a base class the function to call is determin by the type of the object a given function is overridden when there exist no differ in the number or type of paramet between two or more definit of that function henc at compil time it mai not be possibl to determin the type of the object and therefor the correct function to call given onli a base class pointer the decis is therefor put off until runtim thi is call dynam dispatch virtual member function or method allow the most specif implement of the function to be call accord to the actual run time type of the object in c implement thi is commonli done us virtual function tabl if the object type is known thi mai be bypass by prepend a fulli qualifi class name befor the function call but in gener call to virtual function ar resolv at run time in addit to standard member function oper overload and destructor can be virtual as a rule of thumb if ani function in the class is virtual the destructor should be as well as the type of an object at it creation is known at compil time constructor and by extens copi constructor cannot be virtual nonetheless a situat mai aris where a copi of an object need to be creat when a pointer to a deriv object is pass as a pointer to a base object in such a case a common solut is to creat a clone or similar virtual function that creat and return a copi of the deriv class when call a member function can also be made pure virtual by append it with after the close parenthesi and befor the semicolon a class contain a pure virtual function is call an abstract data type object cannot be creat from abstract data type thei can onli be deriv from ani deriv class inherit the virtual function as pure and must provid a non pure definit of it and all other pure virtual function befor object of the deriv class can be creat a program that attempt to creat an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherit pure virtual member function is ill form lambda express edit c provid support for anonym function which ar also known as lambda express a lambda express ha the follow form captur paramet return type function bodi the captur list support the definit of closur such lambda express ar defin in the standard as syntact sugar for an unnam
