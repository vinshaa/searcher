challeng and remov novemb in comput scienc a remot procedur call rpc is an inter process commun that allow a comput program to caus a subroutin or procedur to execut in anoth address space commonli on anoth comput on a share network without the programm explicitli code the detail for thi remot interact that is the programm write essenti the same code whether the subroutin is local to the execut program or remot when the softwar in question us object orient principl rpc is call remot invoc or remot method invoc rmi mani differ often incompat technolog have been us to implement the concept

remot procedur call goe back at least to the s in earli arpanet document bruce jai nelson is gener credit with coin the term on of the first busi us of rpc wa by xerox under the name courier in the first popular implement of rpc on unix wa sun s rpc now call onc rpc us as the basi for network file system messag pass edit an rpc is initi by the client which send a request messag to a known remot server to execut a specifi procedur with suppli paramet the remot server send a respons to the client and the applic continu it process while the server is process the call the client is block it wait until the server ha finish process befor resum execut unless the client send an asynchron request to the server such as an xhttp call there ar mani variat and subtleti in variou implement result in a varieti of differ incompat rpc protocol an import differ between remot procedur call and local call is that remot call can fail becaus of unpredict network problem also caller gener must deal with such failur without know whether the remot procedur wa actual invok idempot procedur those that have no addit effect if call more than onc ar easili handl but enough difficulti remain that code to call remot procedur is often confin to carefulli written low level subsystem sequenc of event dure an rpc edit the client call the client stub the call is a local procedur call with paramet push on to the stack in the normal wai the client stub pack the paramet into a messag and make a system call to send the messag pack the paramet is call marshal the client s local oper system send the messag from the client machin to the server machin the local oper system on the server machin pass the incom packet to the server stub the server stub unpack the paramet from the messag unpack the paramet is call unmarshal final the server stub call the server procedur the repli trace the same step in the revers direct standard contact mechan edit to let differ client access server a number of standard
