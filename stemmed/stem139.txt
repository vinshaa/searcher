portal java refer to a number of comput softwar product and specif from sun microsystem that togeth provid a system for develop applic softwar and deploi it in a cross platform environ java is us in a wide varieti of comput platform from embed devic and mobil phone to enterpris server and supercomput java is nearli ubiquit in mobil phone web server and enterpris applic and while less common on desktop comput java applet ar often us to provid improv function while brows the world wide web code is produc through write in the java program languag then execut by a java virtual machin jvm in sun microsystem made the bulk of it implement of java avail under a public licens more about java show new select below purg edit select articl virtual machin a virtual machin vm is a softwar implement of a machin i e a comput that execut program like a physic machin a virtual machin wa origin defin by popek and goldberg as an effici isol duplic of a real machin current us includ virtual machin which have no direct correspond to ani real hardwar virtual machin ar separ into two major categori base on their us and degre of correspond to ani real machin a system virtual machin provid a complet system platform which support the execut of a complet oper system os in contrast a process virtual machin is design to run a singl program which mean that it support a singl process an essenti characterist of a virtual machin is that the softwar run insid is limit to the resourc and abstract provid by the virtual machin it cannot break out of it virtual world process virtual machin a process vm sometim call an applic virtual machin run as a normal applic insid an os and support a singl process it is creat when that process is start and destroi when it exit it purpos is to provid a platform independ program environ that abstract awai detail of the underli hardwar or oper system and allow a program to execut in the same wai on ani platform a process vm provid a high level abstract that of a high level program languag compar to the low level isa abstract of the system vm process vm ar implement us an interpret perform compar to compil program languag is achiev by the us of just in time compil thi type of vm ha becom popular with the java program languag which is implement us the java virtual machin anoth exampl is the net framework which run on a vm call the common languag runtim a special case of process vm ar system that abstract over the commun mechan of a potenti heterogen comput cluster such a vm doe not consist of a singl process but on process per physic machin in the cluster thei ar design to eas the task of program parallel applic by let the programm focu on algorithm rather than the commun mechan provid by the interconnect and the os thei do not hide the fact that commun take place and as such do not attempt to present the cluster as a singl parallel machin unlik other process vm these system do not provid a specif program languag but ar embed in an exist languag typic such a system provid bind for sever languag e g c and fortran exampl ar pvm parallel virtual machin and mpi messag pass interfac thei ar not strictli virtual machin as the applic run on top still have access to all os servic and ar therefor not confin to the system model provid by the vm system virtual machin system virtual machin sometim call hardwar virtual machin allow the share of the underli physic machin resourc between differ virtual machin each run it own oper system the softwar layer provid the virtual is call a virtual machin monitor or hypervisor a hypervisor can run on bare hardwar type or nativ vm or on top of an oper system type or host vm the main advantag of system vm ar multipl os environ can co exist on the same comput in strong isol from each other the virtual machin can provid an instruct set architectur isa that is somewhat differ from that of the real machin applic provis mainten high avail and disast recoveri the main disadvantag of system vm is a virtual machin is less effici than a real machin becaus it access the hardwar indirectli multipl vm each run their own oper system call guest oper system ar frequent us in server consolid where differ servic that us to run on individu machin in order to avoid interfer ar instead run in separ vm on the same physic machin thi us is frequent call qualiti of servic isol qo isol the desir to run multipl oper system wa the origin motiv for virtual machin as it allow time share a singl comput between sever singl task os thi techniqu requir a process to share the cpu resourc between guest oper system and memori virtual to share the memori on the host the guest os do not have to be all the same make it possibl to run differ os on the same comput e g microsoft window and linux or older version of an os in order to support softwar that ha not yet been port to the latest version the us of virtual machin to support differ guest os is becom popular in embed system a typic us is to support a real time oper system at the same time as a high level os such as linux or window anoth us is to sandbox an os that is not trust possibl becaus it is a system under develop virtual machin have other advantag for os develop includ better debug access and faster reboot altern techniqu such as solari zone provid a level of isol within a singl oper system thi doe not have isol as complet as a vm a kernel exploit in a system with multipl zone will affect all zone achiev the same goal in a virtual machin implement would requir exploit a weak in the hypervisor a hypervisor typic ha a smaller attack surfac than a complet oper system make thi more challeng further a kernel exploit in a vm guest would not affect other vm on the host just as a success intrus into on zone would not necessarili affect other zone zone ar not virtual machin but an exampl of oper system virtual thi includ other virtual environ also call virtual server such as virtuozzo freebsd jail linux vserver chroot jail and openvz these provid some form of encapsul of process within an oper system these technolog have the advantag of be more resourc effici than full virtual and have better observ into multipl guest simultan the disadvantag is that gener thei can onli run a singl oper system and a singl version patch level of that oper system so for exampl thei cannot be us to run two applic on of which onli support a newer os version and the other onli support an older os version on the same hardwar howev sun microsystem ha enhanc solari zone to allow some zone to behav like solari or solari
