is a compil and interpret for the scheme program languag that compil scheme code to standard c it is mostli r rs compliant and offer mani extens to the standard chicken is free softwar avail under the bsd licens it is implement mostli in scheme with some part in c for perform or to make embed into c program easier content focu design limit and deviat from the standard add on softwar featur foreign function interfac cross compil modul and macro limit static type analysi see also refer extern link focu edit chicken s focu is immedi clear from it taglin a practic and portabl scheme system chicken s main focu is the practic applic of scheme for write real world softwar scheme is well known for it us in comput scienc curricula and program languag experiment but it hasn t seen much us in busi and industri chicken s commun ha produc a larg set of librari for perform a varieti of task the chicken wiki the softwar run it is also a chicken program also contain a list of softwar that peopl have written in chicken chicken s other goal is to be portabl by compil to portabl c like gambit and bigloo program written in chicken can be compil for common popular platform like linux mac os x and other unix like system as well as window haiku and the mobil platform io and android it also ha built in support for cross compil of program and extens which allow it to be us on variou embed platform design edit like mani scheme compil chicken us standard c as an intermedi languag a scheme program is translat into c by the chicken compil and then a c compil translat the c program into machin code for the target architectur produc an execut program the univers avail of c make it ideal for thi purpos chicken s design wa inspir by a paper by henri baker that outlin an innov strategi for scheme compil into c a scheme program is compil into c function these c function never reach the return statement instead thei call a new continu when complet these continu ar c function themselv and ar pass on as extra argument to other c function thei ar calcul by the compil so far thi is the essenc of continu pass style baker s novel idea is to us the c stack for the scheme heap henc normal c stack oper such as automat variabl creation variabl size arrai alloc and so on can be us when the stack fill up that is the stack pointer reach the top of the stack a garbag collect can be initi the design us is a copi garbag collector origin devis by c j chenei which copi all live continu and other live object to the heap despit thi the c code doe not copi c stack frame onli scheme object so it doe not requir knowledg of the c implement in full the scheme heap consist of the c stack as the nurseri togeth with the two heap requir by the gener garbag collector thi approach give the speed of the c stack for mani oper and it allow the us of continu as simpl call to c function further baker s solut guarante asymptot tail recurs behavior as requir by the scheme languag standard the implement in the chicken scheme compil is even asymptot safe for space limit and deviat from the standard edit chicken scheme is mostli r rs compliant with a few notabl limit and deviat there is current a guarante maximum of argument to a procedur on common platform up to argument ar support there is no support for the full numer tower in the core system howev an extens librari exist which add support for the full numer tower the next major version will remov thi limit the core system ha basic support for utf charact howev the string index and manipul procedur ar not utf awar here again there is an extens librari which add support for full utf awar add on softwar edit chicken ha a larg repositori of addit librari and program call egg thi egg system is quit similar to rubygem origin research initi these egg were develop in on central svn repositori in which creat a tag would automat caus a new version of the extens to becom avail for download current egg can be develop anywher and under ani version control system while still maintain semi automat releas manag when us most of the popular code host site thi releas method is vc agnost in the sens that the user doe not need to have these vcse instal the develop is free to host anywher he or she like and could even choos to avoid public version control altogeth and distribut onli plain tarbal for all releas egg the latest version is test automat as part of a continu integr process anyon can volunt to suppli addit test capac on differ hardwar or differ oper system or on differ core releas but there s also a canon test server where the core system and all egg will be test daili against the most recent develop version to catch regress bug as well as the most recent stabl version to ensur that everyth work for user of the stabl system featur edit chicken support most of r rs standard scheme but it also add a few nonstandard featur which ar not avail in all scheme implement foreign function interfac edit as mention abov chicken compil to c which make it possibl to inject custom c code into the compil result which eas integr with c librari it foreign function interfac support convert back and forth between most built in c type and correspond scheme object there ar also extens librari for interfac to python lua and java via jni or through a bridg cross compil edit it is rel easi to cross compil scheme code to anoth platform for exampl for embed us on a devic in order to make cross compil possibl for scheme code chicken impos a model of separ compil a compil modul consist of two share librari on librari contain the actual code which will be us at runtim compil for the target platform and the other is an import modul which will be us to load the code which run at compil time on the host platform such as procedur macro code the chicken compil itself can also be easili cross compil after translat to c ha been achiev on can simpli us a c compil which is set up to build for anoth platform modul and macro edit sinc version chicken ha a built in modul system and support for low level hygien macro through explicit renam prior to chicken thi wa avail through an add on librari standard syntax rule macro ar also support as well as implicit renam macro which is basic a revers version of explicit renam thi mechan trade in perform for conveni each identifi not explicitli inject as unhygien will be automat renam to avoid name captur the perform cost li in the fact that thi implicit renam requir the macro expand to travers the express an addit two time thi cost is paid at expans time so a macro author must consid whether longer compil time ar accept limit static type analysi edit more recent support wa ad for local flow analysi thi allow the compil to catch variabl type error at compil time and perform type specialis thi specialis make it possibl to remov sever safeti check for type detect at runtim when the type can be deduc at compil time thi result in improv run time perform thi scrutin doe not allow cross modul flow analysi so it can onli be us to optim code that s part of on compil unit or modul see also edit comput program portal tail recursionchenei s algorithm m t a a song refer
