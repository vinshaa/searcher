common gatewai interfac from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search thi articl is about softwar interfac between the web server and program for other us see cgi disambigu common gatewai interfac cgi is a standard environ for web server to interfac with execut program instal on a server that gener web page dynam such program ar known as cgi script or simpli cgi thei ar usual written in a script languag but can be written in ani program languag content histori overview syntax deploy us altern see also refer extern link histori edit the offici cgi logo from the spec announc in the nation center for supercomput applic ncsa team wrote the specif for call command line execut on the www talk mail list howev ncsa no longer host the specif the other web server develop adopt it and it ha been a standard for web server ever sinc a work group chair by ken coar start in novemb to get the ncsa definit of cgi more formal defin thi work result in rfc which specifi cgi version specif

author of the plexu web server georg phillip web server maintain at the univers of british columbia overview edit each web server run http server softwar which respond to request from web browser gener the http server ha a directori folder which is design as a document collect file that can be sent to web browser connect to thi server for exampl if the web server ha the domain name exampl com and it document collect is store at usr local apach htdoc in the local file system then the web server will respond to a request for http exampl com index html by send out the pre written file at usr local apach htdoc index html cgi extend thi system by allow the owner of the web server to design a directori within the document collect as contain execut script or binari file instead of pre written page thi is known as a cgi directori for exampl usr local apach htdoc cgi bin could be design as a cgi directori on the web server if a web browser request a url that point to a file within the cgi directori e g http exampl com cgi bin printenv pl then instead of simpli send that file usr local apach htdoc cgi bin printenv pl to the web browser the http server run the specifi script and pass the output of the script to the web browser that is anyth that the script send to standard output is pass to the web client instead of be shown on screen in a termin window the cgi system also allow the web browser to send inform to the script via the url or an http post request if a slash and addit directori name s ar append to the url immedi after the name of the script then that path is store in the path info environ variabl befor the script is call if paramet ar sent to the script via an http get request a question mark append to the url follow by param valu pair then those paramet ar store in the queri string environ variabl befor the script is call if paramet ar sent to the script via an http post request thei ar pass to the script s standard input the script can then read these

deploy edit a web server that support cgi can be configur to interpret a url that it serv as a refer to a cgi script a common convent is to have a cgi bin directori at the base of the directori tree and treat all execut file within thi directori and no other for secur as cgi script anoth popular convent is to us filenam extens for instanc if cgi script ar consist given the extens cgi the web server can be configur to interpret all such file as cgi script while conveni and requir by mani prepackag script it open the server to attack if a remot user can upload execut code with the proper extens citat need in the case of http put or post the user submit data ar provid to the program via the standard input the web server creat a subset of the environ variabl pass to it and add detail pertin to the http environ us edit an exampl of a cgi program is on implement a wiki the user agent request the name of an entri the web server execut the cgi the cgi program retriev the sourc of that entri s page if on exist transform it into html and print the result the web server receiv the input from the cgi and transmit it to the user agent if the edit thi page link is click the cgi popul an html textarea or other edit control with the page s content and save it back to the server when the user submit the form altern edit call a command gener mean the invoc of a newli creat process on the server start the process can consum much more time and memori than the actual work of gener the output especi when the program still need to be interpret or compil if the command is call often the result workload can quickli overwhelm the server the overhead involv in interpret mai be reduc by us compil cgi program such as those in c c rather than us perl or other interpret languag the overhead involv in process creation can be reduc by techniqu such as fastcgi that prefork interpret process or by run the applic code entir within the web server us extens modul such as mod php sever approach can be adopt for remedi thi the popular web server develop their own extens mechan that allow third parti softwar to run insid the web server itself such as apach modul nsapi plugin and isapi plugin simpl common gatewai interfac or scgifastcgi allow a singl long run process to handl more than on user request while keep close to the cgi program model retain the simplic while elimin the overhead of creat a new process for each request unlik convert an applic to a web server plug in fastcgi applic remain independ of the web server replac of the architectur for dynam websit can also be us thi is the approach taken by java ee which run java code in a java servlet contain in order to serv dynam content and option static content thi approach replac the overhead of gener and destroi process with the much lower overhead of gener and destroi thread and also expos the programm to the librari that come with java platform standard edit on which the version of java ee in us is base the optim
