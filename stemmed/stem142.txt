came to me and want to pai me a lot of monei to build a larg scale messag handl system that realli had to be up all the time could never afford to go down for year at a time i would unhesitatingli choos erlang to build it in function program exampl edit an erlang function that us recurs to count to ten modul count to ten export count to ten count to ten do count do count do count valu do count valu a factori algorithm implement in erlang modul fact thi is the file fact erl the modul and the filenam must match export fac thi export the function fac of ariti paramet no type no name fac if then return otherwis note the semicolon mean els fac n when n is integ n n fac n recurs determin then return the result note the period mean endif or function end thi function will crash if anyth other than a posit integ is given it illustr the let it crash philosophi of erlang a fibonacci algorithm implement in erlang note thi is onli for demonstr the erlang syntax thi algorithm is rather slow modul fib thi is the file fib erl the modul and the filenam must match export fib thi export the function fib of ariti fib if then return otherwis note the semicolon mean els fib if then return otherwis fib n fib n fib n a sort algorithm similar to quicksort qsort qsort list sort a list of item modul qsort thi is the file qsort erl export qsort a function qsort with paramet is export no type

rest front pivot is a list comprehens mean construct a list of element front such that front is a member of rest and front is less than pivot is the list concaten oper a comparison function can be us for more complic structur for the sake of readabl the follow code would sort list accord to length thi is file listsort erl the compil is made thi wai modul listsort export by length with paramet don

ignor the second paramet qsort pivot rest smaller partit list with smaller element in front of pivot and not smaller element after pivot and sort the sublist qsort x x rest smaller x pivot smaller pivot qsort y y rest not smaller y pivot smaller here again a pivot is taken from the first paramet given to qsort and the rest of list is name rest note that the express x x rest smaller x pivot is no differ in form from front front rest front pivot in the previou exampl except for the us of a comparison function in the last part sai construct a list of element x such that x is a member of rest and smaller is true with smaller be defin earlier as fun a b length a length b end note also that the anonym function is name smaller in the paramet list of the second definit of qsort so that it can be referenc by that name within that function it is not name in the first definit of qsort which deal with the base case of an empti list and thu ha no need of thi function let alon a name for it data
