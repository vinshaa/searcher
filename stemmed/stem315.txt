process comput from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search not to be confus with processor comput a list of process as displai by htop in comput a process is an instanc of a comput program that is be execut it contain the program code and it current activ depend on the oper system os a process mai be made up of multipl thread of execut that execut instruct concurr a comput program is a passiv collect of instruct a process is the actual execut of those instruct sever process mai be associ with the same program for exampl open up sever instanc of the same program often mean more than on process is be execut multitask is a method to allow multipl process to share processor cpu and other system resourc each cpu execut a singl task at a time howev multitask allow each processor to switch between task that ar be execut without have to wait for each task to finish depend on the oper system implement switch could be perform when task perform input output oper when a task indic that it can be switch or on hardwar interrupt a common form of multitask is time share time share is a method to allow fast respons for interact user applic in time share system context switch ar perform rapidli thi make it seem like multipl process ar be execut simultan on the same processor the execut of multipl process seemingli simultan is call concurr for secur and reliabl most modern oper system prevent direct commun between independ process provid strictli mediat and control inter process commun function content represent process manag in multi task oper system process state inter process commun histori see also note refer further read extern link represent edit in gener a comput system process consist of or is said to own the follow resourc an imag of the execut machin code associ with a program memori typic some region of virtual memori which includ the execut code process specif data input and output a call stack to keep track of activ subroutin and or other event and a heap to hold intermedi comput data gener dure run time oper system descriptor of resourc that ar alloc to the process such as file descriptor unix terminolog or handl window and data sourc and sink secur attribut such as the process owner and the process set of permiss allow oper processor state context such as the content of regist physic memori address etc the state is typic store in comput regist when the process is execut and in memori otherwis the oper system hold most of thi inform about activ process in data structur call process control block ani subset of resourc but typic at least the processor state mai be associ with each of the process thread in oper system that support thread or daughter process the oper system keep it process separ and alloc the resourc thei need so that thei ar less like to interfer with each other and caus system failur e g deadlock or thrash the oper system mai also provid mechan for inter process commun to enabl process to interact in safe and predict wai process manag in multi task oper system edit main articl process manag comput a multitask oper system mai just switch between process to give the appear of mani process execut concurr or simultan though in fact onli on process can be execut at ani on time on a singl core cpu unless us multithread or other similar technolog a it is usual to associ a singl process with a main program and daughter or child process with ani spin off parallel process which behav like asynchron subroutin a process is said to own resourc of which an imag of it program in memori is on such resourc note howev that in multiprocess system mani process mai run off of or share the same reentrant program at the same locat in memori but each process is said to own it own imag of the program process ar often call task in embed oper system the sens of process or task is someth that take up time as oppos to memori which is someth that take up space b the abov descript appli to both process manag by an oper system and process as defin by process calculi if a process request someth for which it must wait it will be block when the process is in the block state it is elig for swap to disk but thi is transpar in a virtual memori system where region of a process s memori mai be realli on disk and not in main memori at ani time note that even unus portion of activ process task execut program ar elig for swap to disk all part of an execut program and it data do not have to be in physic memori for the associ process to be activ process state edit main articl process state the variou process state displai in a state diagram with arrow indic possibl transit between state an oper system kernel that allow multi task need process to have certain state name for these state ar not standardis but thei have similar function first the process is creat it is load from a secondari storag devic hard disk or cd rom into main memori after that the process schedul assign it the state wait while the process is wait it wait for the schedul to do a so call context switch and load the process into the processor the process state then becom run and the processor execut the process instruct if a process need to wait for a resourc wait for user input or file to open it is assign the block state the process state is chang back to wait when the process no longer need to wait onc the process finish execut or is termin by the oper system it is no longer need the process is remov instantli or is move to the termin state when remov it just wait to be remov from main memori inter process commun edit main articl inter process commun when process commun with each other it is call inter process commun ipc process frequent need to commun for instanc in a shell pipelin the output of the first process need to pass to the second on and so on to the other process it is prefer in a well structur wai not us interrupt it is even possibl for the two process to be run on differ machin the oper system os mai differ from on process to the other therefor some mediat s call protocol ar need histori edit see also histori of oper system by the earli s comput control softwar had evolv from monitor control softwar for exampl ibsi to execut control softwar over time comput got faster while comput time wa still neither cheap nor fulli util such an environ made multiprogram possibl and necessari multiprogram mean that sever program run at the same time or concurr at first more than on program ran on a singl processor as a result of underli uniprocessor comput architectur and thei share scarc and limit hardwar resourc multiprogram is also basic form of multiprocess which is a much broader term program consist of sequenc of instruct for processor a singl processor can run onli on instruct at a time it is imposs to run more program at the same time a program might need some resourc such as an input devic which ha a larg delai or a program might start some slow oper such as send output to a printer thi would lead to processor be idl unus to keep the processor busi at all time the execut of such a program is halt and the oper system switch the processor to run anoth program to the user it will appear that the program run at the same time henc the term concurr shortli thereaft the notion of a program wa expand to the notion of an execut program and it context the concept of a process wa born thi becam necessari with the invent of re entrant code thread came somewhat later howev with the advent of time share comput network multipl cpu share memori comput etc the old multiprogram gave wai to true multitask multiprocess and later multithread see also edit comput portal child processexitforklightweight processorphan processpar processprocess

in intel s hyper thread technolog can simul simultan execut of multipl process or thread task and process refer essenti to the same entiti and although thei have somewhat differ terminolog histori thei have come to be us as synonym todai the term process is gener prefer over task except when refer to multitask sinc the altern term multiprocess is too easi to confus with multiprocessor which is
