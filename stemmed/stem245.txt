network socket from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search thi articl mai be in need of reorgan to compli with wikipedia s layout guidelin pleas help by edit the articl to make improv to the overal structur june a network socket is an endpoint of an inter process commun across a comput network todai most commun between comput is base on the internet protocol therefor most network socket ar internet socket a socket api is an applic program interfac api usual provid by the oper system that allow applic program to control and us network socket internet socket api ar usual base on the berkelei socket standard a socket address is the combin of an ip address and a port number much like on end of a telephon connect is the combin of a phone number and a particular extens base on thi address internet socket deliv incom data packet to the appropri applic process or thread content overview socket type socket state and the client server model socket pair implement earli implement socket in network equip see also refer extern link overview edit an internet socket is character by at least the follow local socket address local ip address and port numberprotocol a transport protocol e g tcp udp raw ip or other consequ tcp port and udp port ar differ distinct socket a socket that ha been connect to anoth socket e g dure the establish of a tcp connect will also be character by the follow remot socket address as discuss in the client server section below a tcp server mai serv sever client concurr the server creat on socket for each client and these socket share the same local socket address from the point of view of the tcp server and have a differ remot address for each client within the oper system and the applic that creat a socket a socket is refer to by a uniqu integ valu call a socket descriptor the oper system forward the payload of incom ip packet to the correspond applic by extract the socket address inform from the ip and transport protocol header and strip the header from the applic data in ietf request for comment internet standard in mani textbook as well as in thi articl the term socket refer to an entiti that is uniqu identifi by the socket number in other textbook the socket term refer to a local socket address i e a combin of an ip address and a port number in the origin definit of socket given in rfc as it wa relat to the arpa network in the socket is specifi as a bit number with even socket identifi receiv socket and odd socket identifi send socket todai howev socket commun ar bidirect on unix like and microsoft window base oper system the netstat command line tool mai be us to list all current establish socket and relat inform socket type edit sever internet socket type ar avail datagram socket also known as connectionless socket which us user datagram protocol udp stream socket also known as connect orient socket which us transmiss control protocol tcp or stream control transmiss protocol sctp raw socket or raw ip socket typic avail in router and other network equip here the transport layer is bypass and the packet header ar made access to the applic other socket type ar implement over other transport protocol such as system network architectur sna see also unix domain socket ud for intern inter process commun socket state and the client server model edit comput process that provid applic servic ar refer to as server and creat socket on start up that ar in listen state these socket ar wait for initi from client program a tcp server mai serv sever client concurr by creat a child process for each client and establish a tcp connect between the child process and the client uniqu dedic socket ar creat for each connect these ar in establish state when a socket to socket virtual connect or virtual circuit vc also known as a tcp session is establish with the remot socket provid a duplex byte stream a server mai creat sever concurr establish tcp socket with the same local port number and local ip address each map to it own server child process serv it own client process thei ar treat as differ socket by the oper system sinc the remot socket address the client ip address and or port number ar differ i e sinc thei have differ socket pair tupl a udp socket cannot be in an establish state sinc udp is connectionless therefor netstat doe not show the state of a udp socket a udp server doe not creat new child process for everi concurr serv client but the same process handl incom data packet from all remot client sequenti through the same socket it impli that udp socket ar not identifi by the remot address but onli by the local address although each messag ha an associ remot address socket pair edit commun local and remot socket ar call socket pair each socket pair is describ by a uniqu tupl consist of sourc and destin ip address and port number i e of local and remot socket address as seen in the discuss abov in the tcp case each uniqu socket pair tupl is assign a socket number while in the udp case each uniqu local socket address is assign a socket number implement edit socket ar usual implement by an applic program interfac api librari such as berkelei socket first introduc in most implement ar base on berkelei socket for exampl winsock introduc in other api implement exist such as the stream base transport layer interfac tli develop of applic program that util thi api is call socket program or network program earli implement edit berkelei socket also known as the bsd socket api origin with the bsd unix oper system releas in as an api onli in howev could uc

of the internet model network equip such as router and switch do not requir implement of the transport layer as thei oper on the link layer level switch or at the internet layer router howev state network firewal network address translat and proxi server keep track of activ socket pair also in fair queu layer switch and qualiti of servic qo support in router packet flow mai be identifi by
