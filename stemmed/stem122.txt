research that in mani wai defin the modern world of comput in addit to smalltalk work prototyp of thing such as hypertext gui multimedia the mous telepres and the internet were develop by arpa research in the s alan kai on of the inventor of smalltalk also describ a tablet comput he call the dynabook which wa essenti a design for an ipad smalltalk environ were often the first to develop what ar now common object orient softwar design pattern on of the most popular is the model view control pattern for user interfac design the mvc pattern enabl develop to have multipl consist view of

model mai be view from variou angl and level of abstract in addit to the mvc pattern the smalltalk languag and environ were tremend influenti in the histori of the graphic user interfac gui and the what you see is what you get wysiwyg user interfac font editor and desktop metaphor for ui design the power built in debug and object inspect tool that came with smalltalk environ set the standard for all the integr develop environ start with lisp machin environ that came after object orient program edit main articl object orient program as in other object orient languag the central concept in smalltalk but not in smalltalk is that of an object an object is alwai an instanc of a class class ar blueprint that describ the properti and behavior of their instanc for exampl a gui s window class might declar that window have properti such as the label the posit and whether the window is visibl or not the class might also declar that instanc support oper such as open close move and hide each particular window object would have it own valu of those properti and each of them would be abl to perform oper defin by it class a smalltalk object can do exactli three thing hold state refer to other object receiv a messag from itself or anoth object in the cours of process a messag send messag to itself or anoth object the state an object hold is alwai privat to that object other object can queri or chang that state onli by send request messag to the object to do so ani messag can be sent to ani object when a messag is receiv the receiv determin whether that messag is appropri alan kai ha comment that despit the attent given to object messag is the most import concept in smalltalk the big idea is messag that is what the kernel of smalltalk squeak is all about and it s someth that wa never quit complet in our xerox parc phase smalltalk is a pure object orient program languag mean that unlik java and c there is no differ between valu which ar object and valu which ar primit type in smalltalk primit valu such as integ boolean and charact ar also object in the sens that thei ar instanc of correspond class and oper on them ar invok by send messag a programm can chang or extend through subclass the class that implement primit valu so that new behavior can be defin for their instanc for exampl to implement new control structur or even so that their exist behavior will be chang thi fact is summar in the commonli heard phrase in smalltalk everyth is an object which mai be more accur express as all valu ar object as variabl ar not sinc all valu ar object class themselv ar also object each class is an instanc of the metaclass of that class metaclass in turn ar also object and ar all instanc of a class call metaclass code block smalltalk s wai of express anonym function ar also object reflect edit reflect is a term that comput scientist appli to softwar program that have the capabl to inspect their own structur for exampl their pars tree or datatyp of input and output paramet reflect wa first primarili a featur of interpret languag such as smalltalk and lisp the fact that statement ar interpret mean that the program have access to inform creat as thei were pars and can often even modifi their own structur reflect is also a featur of have a meta model as smalltalk doe the meta model is the model that describ the languag itself and develop can us the meta model to do thing like walk through examin and modifi the pars tree of an object or find all the instanc of a certain kind of structur e g all the instanc of the method class in the meta model smalltalk is a total reflect system implement in smalltalk itself smalltalk provid both structur and comput reflect smalltalk is a structur reflect system whose structur is defin by smalltalk object the class and method that defin the system ar themselv object and fulli part of the system that thei help defin the smalltalk compil compil textual sourc code into method object typic instanc of compiledmethod these get ad to class by store them in a class s method dictionari the part of the class hierarchi that defin class can add new class to the system the system is extend by run smalltalk code that creat or defin class and method in thi wai a smalltalk system is a live system carri around the abil to extend itself at run time sinc the class ar themselv object thei can be ask question such as what method do you implement or what field slot instanc variabl do you defin so object can easili be inspect copi de serial and so on with gener code that appli to ani object in the system smalltalk also provid comput reflect the abil to observ the comput state of the system in languag deriv from the origin smalltalk the current activ of a method is access as an object name via a pseudo variabl on of the six reserv word thiscontext by send messag to thiscontext a method activ can ask question like who sent thi messag to me these facil make it possibl to implement co routin or prolog like back track without modifi the virtual machin the except system is implement us thi facil on of the more interest us of thi is in the seasid web framework which reliev the programm of deal with the complex of a web browser s back button by store continu for each edit page and switch between them as the user navig a web site program the web server us seasid can then be done us a more convent program style an exampl of how smalltalk can us reflect is the mechan for handl error when an object is sent a messag that it doe not implement the virtual machin send the object the doesnotunderstand messag with a reific of the messag as an argument the messag anoth object an instanc of messag contain the selector of the messag and an arrai of it argument in an interact smalltalk system the default implement of doesnotunderstand is on that open an error window a notifi report the error to the user through thi and the reflect facil the user can examin the context in which the error occur redefin the offend code and continu all within the system us smalltalk s reflect facil syntax edit thi section need addit citat for verif pleas help improv thi articl by ad citat to reliabl sourc unsourc materi mai be challeng and remov june smalltalk syntax is rather minimalist base on onli a hand of declar and reserv word in fact onli six keyword ar reserv in smalltalk true fals nil self super and thiscontext these ar actual call pseudo variabl identifi that follow the rule for variabl identifi but denot bind that the programm cannot chang the true fals and nil pseudo variabl ar singleton instanc self and super refer to the receiv of a messag within a method activ in respons to that messag but send to super ar look up in the superclass of the method s defin class rather than the class of the receiv which allow method in subclass to invok method of the same name in superclass thiscontext refer to the current activ record the onli built in languag construct ar messag send assign method return and liter syntax for some object from it origin as a languag for children of all ag standard smalltalk syntax us punctuat in a manner more like english than mainstream code languag the remaind of the languag includ control structur for condit evalu and iter is implement on top of the built in construct by the standard smalltalk class librari for perform reason implement mai recogn and treat as special some of those messag howev thi is onli an optim and is not hardwir into the languag syntax the adag that smalltalk syntax fit on a postcard refer to a code snippet by ralph johnson demonstr all the basic standard syntact element of method examplewithnumb x y true fals not nil isnil iffals self halt y self size super size a a a do each transcript show each class name show x y liter edit the follow exampl illustr the most common object which can be written as liter valu in smalltalk method number the follow list illustr some of the possibl e r ra the last two entri ar a binari and a hexadecim number respect the number befor the r is the radix or base the base doe not have to be a power of two for exampl rsmalltalk is a valid number equal to decim charact

memori in addit to string smalltalk ha a class of charact sequenc object call symbol symbol ar guarante to be uniqu there can be no two equal symbol which ar differ object becaus of that symbol ar veri cheap to compar and ar often us for languag artifact such as messag selector see below symbol ar written as follow by a string liter for exampl foo if the sequenc doe not includ whitespac or punctuat charact thi can also be written as foo arrai defin an arrai of four integ mani implement support the follow liter syntax for bytearrai defin a bytearrai of four integ and last but not least block anonym function liter some smalltalk code block ar explain in detail further in the text mani smalltalk dialect implement addit syntax for other object but the on abov ar the essenti support by all variabl declar edit the two kind of variabl commonli us in smalltalk ar instanc variabl and temporari variabl other variabl and relat terminolog depend on the particular implement for exampl visualwork ha class share variabl and namespac share variabl while squeak and mani other implement have class variabl pool variabl and global variabl temporari variabl declar in smalltalk ar variabl declar insid a method see below thei ar declar at the top of the method as name separ by space and enclos by vertic bar for exampl index declar a temporari variabl name index multipl variabl mai be declar within on set of bar index vowel declar two variabl index and vowel assign edit a variabl is assign a valu via the syntax so vowel aeiou assign the string aeiou to the previous declar vowel variabl the string is an object a sequenc of charact between singl quot is the syntax for liter string creat by the compil at compil time in the origin parc place imag the glyph of the underscor charact appear as a left face arrow like in the version of the ascii code smalltalk origin accept thi left arrow as the onli assign oper some modern code still contain what appear to be underscor act as assign hearken back to thi origin usag most modern smalltalk implement accept either the underscor or the colon equal syntax messag edit the messag is the most fundament languag construct in smalltalk even control structur ar implement as messag send smalltalk adopt by default a synchron singl dynam messag dispatch strategi as contrast to the asynchron multipl dispatch strategi adopt by some other object orient languag the follow exampl send the messag factori to number factori in thi situat is call the messag receiv while factori is the messag selector the receiv respond to the messag by return a valu presum in thi case the factori of among other thing the result of the messag can be assign to a variabl aratherbignumb factori factori abov is what is call a unari messag becaus onli on object the receiv is involv messag can carri addit object as argument as follow raisedto in thi express two object ar involv as the receiv and as the messag argument the messag result or in smalltalk parlanc the answer is suppos to be such messag ar call keyword messag a messag can have more argument us the follow syntax hello world indexof o startingat which answer the index of charact o in the receiv string start the search from index the selector of thi messag is indexof startingat consist of two piec or keyword such interleav of keyword and argument is meant to improv readabl of code sinc argument ar explain by their preced keyword for exampl an express to creat a rectangl us a c or java like syntax might be written as new rectangl it s unclear which argument is which by contrast in smalltalk thi code would be written as rectangl width height the receiv in thi case is rectangl a class and the answer will be a new instanc of the class with the specifi width and height final most of the special non alphabet charact can be us as what ar call binari messag these allow mathemat and logic oper to be written in their tradit form which send the messag to the receiv with pass as the argument the answer of which will be similarli is the messag sent to with argument the answer of which will be fals notic that the smalltalk languag itself doe not impli the mean of those oper the outcom of the abov is onli defin by how the receiv of the messag in thi case a number instanc respond to messag and a side effect of thi mechan is oper overload a messag can also be understood by other object allow the us of express of the form a b to compar them express edit an express can includ multipl messag send in thi case express ar pars accord to a simpl order of preced unari messag have the highest preced follow by binari messag follow by keyword messag for exampl factori factori between and is evalu as follow receiv the messag factori and answer receiv the messag factori and answer receiv the messag with as the argument and answer receiv the messag between and with and as argument and answer true the answer of the last messag sent is the result of the entir express parenthes can alter the order of evalu when need for exampl factori factori between and will chang the mean so that the express first comput factori yield that then receiv the second factori messag yield then receiv between and answer fals note that becaus the mean of binari messag is not hardwir into smalltalk syntax all of them ar consid to have equal preced and ar evalu simpli from left to right becaus of thi the mean of smalltalk express us binari messag can be differ from their tradit interpret is evalu as produc to obtain the expect answer of parenthes must be us to explicitli defin the order of oper unari messag can be chain by write them on after anoth factori factori log which send factori to then factori to the result then log to the result produc the result a seri of express can be written as in the follow hypothet exampl each separ by a period thi exampl first creat a new instanc of class window store it in a variabl and then send two messag to it window window window new window label hello window open if a seri of messag ar sent to the same receiv as in the exampl abov thei can also be written as a cascad with individu messag separ by semicolon window new label hello open thi rewrit of the earlier exampl as a singl express avoid the need to store the new window in a temporari variabl accord to the usual preced rule the unari messag new is sent first and then label and open ar sent to the answer of new code block edit a block of code an anonym function can be express as a liter valu which is an object sinc all valu ar object thi
