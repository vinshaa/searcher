world scientif and through reason and logic avicenna s view on islam theologi and philosophi were enorm influenti form part of the core of the curriculum at islam religi school until the th centuri avicenna wrote a number of short treatis deal with islam theologi these includ treatis on the prophet whom he view as inspir philosoph and also on variou scientif and philosoph interpret of the quran such as how quran cosmolog correspond to hi own philosoph system in gener these treatis link hi philosoph write to islam religi idea for exampl the bodi s afterlif there ar occasion brief hint and allus in hi longer work howev that avicenna consid philosophi as the onli sensibl wai to distinguish real propheci from illus he did not state thi more clearli becaus of the polit implic of such a

epistemolog matter which could onli be properli consid by other philosoph later interpret of avicenna s philosophi split into three differ school those such as al tusi who continu to appli hi philosophi as a system to interpret later polit event and scientif advanc those such as al razi who consid avicenna s theolog work in isol from hi wider philosoph concern and those such as al ghazali who select us part of hi philosophi to support their own attempt to gain greater spiritu insight through a varieti of mystic mean it wa the theolog interpret champion by those such as al razi which

creat all at onc while suspend in the air isol from all sensat which includ no sensori contact with even their own bodi he argu that in thi scenario on would still have self conscious becaus it is conceiv that a person suspend in air while cut off from sens experi would still be capabl of determin hi own exist the thought experi point to the conclus that the soul is a perfect independ of the bodi and an immateri substanc the conceiv of thi float man indic that the soul is perceiv intellectu which entail the soul s separ from the bodi avicenna refer to the live human intellig particularli the activ intellect which he believ to be the hypostasi by which god commun truth to the human mind and impart order and intellig to natur follow is an english translat of the argument on of us i e a human be should be imagin as have been creat in a singl stroke creat perfect and complet but with hi vision obscur so that he cannot perceiv extern entiti creat fall through air or a void in such a manner that he is not struck by the firm of the air in ani wai that compel him to feel it and with hi limb separ so that thei do not come in contact with or touch each other then contempl the follow can he be assur of the exist of himself he doe not have ani doubt in that hi self exist without therebi assert that he ha ani exterior limb nor ani intern organ neither heart nor brain nor ani on of the exterior thing at all but rather he can affirm the exist of himself without therebi assert there that thi self ha ani extens in space even if it were possibl for him in that state to imagin a hand or ani other limb he would not imagin it as be a part of hi self nor as a condit for the exist of that self for as you know that which is assert is differ from that which is not assert and that which is infer is differ from that which is not infer therefor the self the exist of which ha been assert is a uniqu characterist in as much that it is not as such the same as the bodi or the limb which have not been ascertain thu that which is ascertain i e the self doe have a wai of be sure of the exist of the soul as someth other than the bodi even someth non bodili thi he know thi he should understand intuit if it is that he is ignor off it and need to be beaten with a stick to realiz it ibn sina kitab al shifa on the soul howev avicenna posit the brain as the place where reason interact

and the prescript of a regimen avicenna p the benefit of exercis onc the purpos of medicin ha been set forth then from page ibn sina divid the wai of achiev health as sinc the regimen of maintain health consist essenti in the regul of exercis food and sleep we mai begin our discours with the subject of exercis avicenna p exercis itself is divid into three main part the massag which is equival to massag your muscl befor you start to exercis the exercis itself and lastli the cold bath give on of the greatest benefit of the regimen of exercis and then explain the extrem import and necessari need for physic exercis ibn sina state onc we direct the attent toward regul exercis as to amount and time we shall find there is no need for such medicin as ar ordinarili requir for remedi diseas depend on abnorm matter or diseas of tempera consequ upon such thi is true provid the rest of the regimen is appropri and proper avicenna p the valu of exercis includ the follow it harden the organ and render them fit for their function it result in a better absorpt of food aid assimil and by increas the innat heat improv nutrit it clear the pore of the skin it remov effet substanc through the lung it strengthen the physiqu vigor exercis invigor the muscular and nervou system avicenna p in what manner doe ibn sina us the word tempera in sai that exercis cure diseas of tempera ibn sina divid tempera into that which is harmoni and that which is non uniform ibn sina sai on pg in addit to the sign of the normal tempera alreadi given there ar mental faculti includ vigor of imagin intellectu power and memori avicenna p in brief there is non uniform of tempera among the member or perchanc the princip member depart from equabl and come to be of contrari tempera on deviat toward on anoth to it contrari if the compon of the bodi ar out of proport it is unfortun both for talent and reason power avicenna p the purpos of exercis and the danger of it neglig continu on the proof to why exercis should be so benefici ibn sina sai we know that thi must be so when we reflect how in regard to nutriment our health depend on the nutriment be appropri for us and regul in quantiti and qualiti for not on of the aliment which ar capabl of nourish the bodi is convert into actual nutriment in it entireti in everi case digest leav someth untouch and natur take care to have that evacu nevertheless the evacu which natur accomplish is not a complet on henc at the end of each digest there is some superflu left over should thi be a frequent occurr repetit would lead to further aggreg until someth measur ha accumul as a result harm effet substanc would form and injur variou part of the bodi when thei undergo decomposit putrefact diseas aris bacteri infect should thei be strong in qualiti thei will give rise to intempera and if thei should increas in quantiti thei would set up the symptom of plethora which have alreadi been describ flow to some member thei will result in an inflammatori mass and their vapor will destroi the tempera of the substanti basi of the breath that is the reason why we must be care to evacu these substanc their evacu is usual not complet accomplish without the aid of toxic medicin for these break up the natur of the effat substanc thi can be achiev onli by toxic agent although the drink of them is to a certain extent deleteri to our natur as hippocr sai medicin purg and ag more than thi the discharg of superflu humor entail the loss of a larg part of the natur humid and of the breath which is the substanc of life all thi is at the expens of the strength of the princip and the auxiliari member and therefor thei ar weaken therebi these and other thing account for the difficulti incid to plethora whether thei remain behind in the bodi or ar evacu by it avicenna pp just befor thi ibn sina explain how accumul of food in our bodi can caus diseas and on wai to rid us of thi is strong medicin howev as he explain thi is not the ideal wai and certainli not the long term thu to make hi point veri clear and show the extrem necess of daili exercis for health ibn sina state now exercis is that agent which most sure prevent the accumul of these matter and prevent plethora the other form of regiment assist it it is thi exercis which renew and reviv the innat heat and impart the necessari light to the bodi for it caus the subtl heat to be increas and daili dispers whatev effet substanc have accumul the movement of the bodi help them to expel them convei them to those part of the bodi whenc thei can readili leav it henc the effet matter ar not allow to collect dai after dai and besid thi as we have just said exercis caus the innat heat to flourish and keep the joint and ligament firm so as to be alwai readi for servic and also free from injuri it render the member abl to receiv nutriment in be free from accumul effat matter henc it render the member light and the humid attenu and it dilat the pore of the skin to forsak exercis would often incur the risk of hectic becaus the instinct drive of the member ar impair inasmuch as the depriv of movement prevent the access to them of the innat breath and thi last is the real instrument of life for everi on of the member avicenna pp massag befor you begin to exercis it is import that you massag your muscl as ibn sina sai on page massag as a preparatori to athlet the massag
