add on to the languag as a languag maniac and oo fan for year i realli want a genuin object orient easi to us script languag i look for but couldn t find on so i decid to make it matsumoto describ the design of rubi as be like a simpl lisp languag at it core with an object system like that of smalltalk block inspir by higher order function and practic util like that of perl the name rubi edit the name rubi origin dure an onlin chat session between matsumoto and keiju ishitsuka on februari befor ani code had been written for the languag initi two name were propos coral and rubi matsumoto chose

edit yukihiro matsumoto the creator of rubi matsumoto ha said that rubi is design for programm product and fun follow the principl of good user interfac design at a googl tech talk in matsumoto further state i hope to see rubi help everi programm in the world to be product and to enjoi program and to be happi that is the primari purpos of rubi languag he stress that system design need to emphas human rather than comput need often peopl especi comput engin focu on the machin thei think by do thi the machin will run fast by do thi the machin will run more effect by do thi the machin will someth someth someth thei ar focus on machin but in fact we need to focu on human on how human care about do program or oper the applic of the machin we ar the master thei ar the slave rubi is said to follow the principl of least astonish pola mean that the languag should behav in such a wai as to minim confus for experienc user matsumoto ha said hi primari design goal wa to make a languag that he himself enjoi us by minim programm work and possibl confus he ha said that he had not appli the principl of least astonish to the design of rubi but nevertheless the phrase ha come to be close associ with the rubi program languag the phrase ha itself been a sourc of surpris as novic user mai take it to mean that rubi s behavior try to close match behavior familiar from other languag in a mai discuss on the newsgroup comp lang rubi matsumoto attempt to distanc rubi from pola explain that becaus ani design choic will be surpris to someon he us a person standard in evalu surpris if that person standard remain consist there would be few surpris for those familiar with the standard matsumoto defin it thi wai in an interview everyon ha an individu background someon mai come from python someon els mai come from perl and thei mai be surpris by differ aspect of the languag then thei come up to me and sai i wa surpris by thi featur of the languag so rubi violat the principl of least surpris wait wait the principl of least surpris is not for you onli the principl of least surpris mean principl of least my surpris and it mean the principl of least surpris after you learn rubi veri

support for introspect reflect and metaprogram as well as support for interpret base thread rubi featur dynam type and support parametr polymorph accord to the rubi faq the syntax is similar to perl and the semant ar similar to smalltalk but it differ greatli from python non primari sourc need syntax edit the syntax of rubi is broadli similar to that of perl and python class and method definit ar signal by keyword in contrast to perl variabl ar not obligatorili prefix with a sigil when us the sigil chang the semant of scope of the variabl on differ from c and perl is that keyword ar typic us to defin logic code block without brace in other word a pair of and for practic purpos there is no distinct between express and statement line break ar signific and taken as the end of a statement a semicolon mai be equival us unlik python indent is not signific on of the differ of rubi compar to python and perl is that rubi keep all of it instanc variabl complet privat to the class and onli expos them through accessor method attr writer attr reader etc unlik the getter and setter method of other languag like c or java accessor method in rubi can be creat with a singl line of code via metaprogram howev accessor method can also be creat in the tradit fashion of c and java as invoc of these method doe not requir the us of parenthes it is trivial to chang an instanc variabl into a full function without modifi a singl line of code or have to do ani refactor achiev similar function to c and vb net properti member python s properti descriptor ar similar but come with a tradeoff in the develop process if on begin in python by us a publicli expos instanc variabl and later chang the implement to us a privat instanc variabl expos through a properti descriptor code intern to the class mai need to be adjust to us the privat variabl rather than the public properti rubi s design forc all instanc variabl to be privat but also provid a simpl wai to declar set and get method thi is in keep with the idea that in rubi on never directli access the intern member of a class from outsid the class rather on pass a messag to the class and receiv a respons see the exampl section below for sampl of code demonstr rubi syntax differ from other languag edit some featur that differ notabl from languag such as c or perl the languag syntax is sensit to the capit of identifi in all case treat capit variabl as constant class and modul name ar constant and refer to object deriv from class and modul the sigil and do not indic variabl data type as in perl but rather function as scope resolut oper float point liter must have digit on both side of the decim point neither nor ar valid float point liter but and ar in rubi integ liter ar object that can have method appli to them so requir a digit after a decim point help to clarifi whether e should be pars analog to to f or as the exponenti format float liter e the reason for requir a digit befor the decim point is less clear it might relat either to method invoc again or perhap to the and oper for exampl in the fragment boolean non boolean datatyp ar permit in boolean context unlik in e g smalltalk and java but their map to boolean valu differ markedli from some other languag and empti e g empti list string or associ arrai all evalu to true thu chang the mean of some common idiom in relat or similar languag such as lisp perl and python a consequ of thi rule is that rubi method by convent for exampl regular express search return number string list or other non fals valu on success but nil on failur version prior to us plain integ to repres singl charact much like c thi mai caus surpris when slice string abc yield the ascii code of the first charact in the string to obtain a us abc a substr of length or abc chr the notat statement until express doe not run the statement if the express is alreadi true the behavior is like perl but unlik other languag equival statement e g do statement while express in c c thi is becaus statement until express is actual syntact sugar over until express statement end the equival of which in c c is while express statement just as statement if express is equival to if express statement howev the notat begin statement end until express in rubi will in fact run the statement onc even if the express is alreadi true act similar to the do while of other languag matsumoto ha express a desir to remov the special behavior of begin statement end until express but it still exist as of rubi becaus constant ar refer to object chang what a constant refer to gener a warn but modifi the object itself doe not for exampl greet world if greet hello doe not gener an error or warn thi is similar to final variabl in java or a const pointer to a non const object in c but rubi provid the function to freez an object unlik java some featur that differ notabl from other languag the usual oper for condit express and and or do not follow the normal rule of preced and doe not bind tighter than or rubi also ha express oper and that work as expect a list of so call gotcha mai be found in hal fulton s book the rubi wai nd ed isbn section a similar list in the st edit pertain
