content of the soap bodi and ani soap header block target at it in some circumst a soap messag might not reach an ultim soap receiv for exampl becaus of a problem at a soap intermediari an ultim soap

both smtp and http ar valid applic layer protocol us as transport for soap but http ha gain wider accept as it work well with todai s internet infrastructur specif http work well with network firewal soap mai also be us over http which is the same protocol as http at the applic level but us an encrypt transport protocol underneath with either simpl or mutual authent thi is the advoc ws i method to provid web servic secur as state in the ws i basic profil thi is a major advantag over other distribut protocol like giop iiop or dcom which ar normal filter by firewal soap over amqp is yet anoth possibl that some implement support soap also ha an advantag over dcom that it is unaffect by secur right configur on the machin that requir knowledg of both transmit and receiv node thi let soap be loos coupl in a wai that is not possibl with dcom there is also the soap over udp oasi standard messag format edit xml inform set wa chosen as the standard messag format becaus of it widespread us by major corpor and open sourc develop effort typic xml inform set is serial as xml a wide varieti of freeli avail tool significantli eas the transit to a soap base implement the somewhat lengthi syntax of xml can be both a benefit and a drawback while it promot readabl for human facilit error detect and avoid interoper problem such as byte order endian it can slow process speed and can be cumbersom for exampl corba giop ic and dcom us much shorter binari messag format on the other hand hardwar applianc ar avail to acceler process of xml messag binari xml is also be explor as a mean for streamlin the throughput requir of xml xml messag by their self document natur usual have more overhead header footer nest tag delimit than actual data in contrast to earlier protocol where the overhead wa usual a rel small percentag of the overal messag in financi messag soap wa found to result in a time larger messag than previou protocol fix financi inform exchang and cdr common data represent xml inform set doe not have to be serial in xml for instanc a csv or json xml infoset represent exist there is also no need to specifi a gener transform framework the concept of soap bind allow for specif

tunnel easili over exist firewal and proxi without modif to the soap protocol and can us the exist infrastructur disadvantag edit when us standard implement and the default soap http bind the xml
