serial from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search thi articl is about data structur encod for other us see serial disambigu thi articl is written in the style of a debat rather than an encycloped summari it mai requir cleanup to meet wikipedia s qualiti standard and make it more access to a gener audienc pleas discuss thi issu on the talk page march in comput scienc in the context of data storag serial is the process of translat data structur or object state into a format that can be store for exampl in a file or memori buffer or transmit across a network connect link and reconstruct later in the same or anoth comput environ when the result seri of bit is reread accord to the serial format it can be us to creat a semant ident clone of the origin object for mani complex object such as those that make extens us of refer thi process is not straightforward serial of object orient object doe not includ ani of their associ method with which thei were previous inextric link thi process of serial an object is also call marshal an object the opposit oper extract a data structur from a seri of byte is deseri which is also call unmarshal content us consequ serial format program languag support see also refer extern link us edit a method of transfer data through the wire messag a method of store data in databas on hard disk drive a method of remot procedur call e g as in soap a method for distribut object especi in compon base softwar engin such as com corba etc a method for detect chang in time vari data for some of these featur to be us architectur independ must be maintain for exampl for maxim us of distribut a comput run on a differ hardwar architectur should be abl to reliabl reconstruct a serial data stream regardless of endian thi mean that the simpler and faster procedur of directli copi the memori layout of the data structur cannot work reliabl for all architectur serial the data structur in an architectur independ format mean prevent the problem of byte order memori layout or simpli differ wai of repres data structur in differ program languag inher to ani serial scheme is that becaus the encod of the data is by definit serial extract on part of the serial data structur requir that the entir object be read from start to end and reconstruct in mani applic thi linear is an asset becaus it enabl simpl common i o interfac to be util to hold and pass on the state of an object in applic where higher perform is an issu it can make sens to expend more effort to deal with a more complex non linear storag organ even on a singl machin primit pointer object ar too fragil to save becaus the object to which thei point mai be reload to a differ locat in memori to deal with thi the serial process includ a step call unswizzl or pointer unswizzl where direct pointer refer ar convert to refer base on name or posit the deseri process includ an invers step call pointer swizzl sinc both serial and deseri can be driven from common code for exampl the serial function in microsoft foundat class it is possibl for the common code to do both at the same time and thu detect differ between the object be serial and their prior copi and provid the input for the next such detect it is not necessari to actual build the prior copi becaus differ can be detect on the fly the techniqu is call differenti execut it is us in the program of user interfac whose content ar time vari graphic object can be creat remov alter or made to handl input event without necessarili have to write separ code to do those thing consequ edit serial break the opac of an abstract data type by potenti expos privat implement detail trivial implement which serial all data member mai violat encapsul to discourag competitor from make compat product publish of proprietari softwar often keep the detail of their program serial format a trade secret some deliber obfusc or even encrypt the serial data yet interoper requir that applic be abl to understand each other s serial format therefor remot method call architectur such as corba defin their serial format in detail mani institut such as archiv and librari attempt to futur proof their backup archiv in particular databas dump by store them in some rel human readabl serial format serial format edit main articl comparison of data serial format the xerox network system courier technolog in the earli s influenc the first wide adopt standard sun microsystem publish the extern data represent xdr in in the late s a push to provid an altern to the standard serial protocol start xml wa us to produc a human readabl text base encod such an encod can be us for persist object that mai be read and understood by human or commun to other system regardless of program languag it ha the disadvantag of lose the more compact byte stream base encod but by thi point larger storag and transmiss capac made file size less of a concern than in the earli dai of comput binari xml had been propos as a compromis which wa not readabl by plain text editor but wa more compact than regular xml in the s xml wa often us for asynchron transfer of structur data between client and server in ajax web applic json is a more lightweight plain text altern to xml which is also commonli us for client server commun in web applic json is base on javascript syntax but is support in other program languag as well anoth altern yaml is effect a superset of json and includ featur that make it more power for serial more human friendli and potenti more compact these featur includ a notion of tag data type support for non hierarch data structur the option to structur data with indent and multipl form of scalar data quot anoth human readabl serial format is the properti list format us in nextstep gnustep and mac os x cocoa for larg volum scientif dataset such as satellit data and output of numer climat weather or ocean model specif binari serial standard have been develop e g hdf netcdf and the older grib program languag support edit sever object orient program languag directli support object serial or object archiv either by syntact sugar element or provid a standard interfac for do so some of these program languag ar rubi smalltalk python php object c java and the net famili of languag there ar also librari avail that add serial support to languag that lack nativ support for it javajava provid automat serial which requir that the object be mark by implement the java io serializ interfac implement the interfac mark the class as okai to serial and java then handl serial intern there ar no serial method defin on the serializ interfac but a serializ class can option defin method with certain special name and signatur that if defin will be call as part of the serial deseri process the languag also allow the develop to overrid the serial process more thoroughli by implement anoth interfac the externaliz interfac which includ two special method that ar us to save and restor the object s state there ar three primari reason why object ar not serializ by default and must implement the serializ interfac to access java s serial mechan firstli not all object captur us semant in a serial state for exampl a thread object is ti to the state of the current jvm there is no context in which a deseri thread object would maintain us semant secondli the serial state of an object form part of it class compat contract maintain compat between version of serializ class requir addit effort and consider therefor make a class serializ need to be a deliber design decis and not a default condit lastli serial allow access to non transient privat member of a class that ar not otherwis access class contain sensit inform for exampl a password should not be serializ nor externaliz the standard encod method us a simpl translat of the field into a byte stream primit as well as non transient non static referenc object ar encod into the stream each object that is referenc by the serial object and not mark as transient must also be serial and if ani object in the complet graph of non transient object refer is not serializ then serial will fail the develop can influenc thi behavior by mark object as transient or by redefin the serial for an object so that some portion of the refer graph is truncat and not serial it is possibl to serial java object through jdbc and store them into a databas citat need while swing compon do implement the serializ interfac thei ar not portabl between differ version of the java virtual machin as such a swing compon or ani compon which inherit it mai be serial to an arrai of byte but it is not guarante that thi storag will be readabl on anoth machin net framework net framework ha sever serial design by microsoft there ar also mani serial by third parti more than a dozen serial ar discuss and test here and here the list is constantli grow cfmlcfml allow data structur to be serial to wddx with the cfwddx tag and to json with the serializejson function ocamlocaml s standard librari provid marshal through the marshal modul it document and the pervas function output valu and input valu while ocaml program is static type check us of the marshal modul mai break type guarante as there is no wai to check whether an unmarshal stream repres object of the expect type in ocaml it is difficult to marshal a function or a data structur which contain a function e g an object which contain a method becaus execut code in function cannot be transmit across differ program there is a flag to marshal the code posit of a function but it can onli be unmarshal in exactli the same program the standard marshal function can preserv share and handl cyclic data which can be configur by a flag perlsever perl modul avail from cpan provid serial mechan
