thei check xml document for valid a processor that discov a valid error must be abl to report it but mai continu normal process a dtd is an exampl of a schema or grammar sinc the initi public of xml there ha been substanti work in the area of schema languag for xml such schema languag typic constrain the set of element that mai be us in a document which attribut mai be appli to them the order in which thei mai appear and the allow parent child relationship document type definit edit main articl document type definit the oldest schema languag for xml is the document type definit dtd inherit

dtd allow the declar of standard public entiti set for publish charact dtd defin a document type rather than the type us by a namespac thu group all constraint for a document in a singl collect dtd have the follow limit thei have no explicit support for newer featur of xml most importantli namespac thei lack express xml dtd ar simpler than sgml dtd and there ar certain structur that cannot be express with regular grammar dtd onli support rudimentari datatyp thei lack readabl dtd design typic make heavi us of paramet entiti which behav essenti as textual macro which make it easier to defin complex grammar but at the expens of clariti thei us a syntax base on regular express syntax inherit from sgml to describ the schema typic xml api such as sax do not attempt to offer applic a structur represent of the syntax so it is less access to programm than an element base syntax mai be two peculiar featur that distinguish dtd from other schema type ar the syntact support for embed a dtd within xml document and for defin entiti which ar arbitrari fragment of text and or markup that the xml processor insert in the dtd itself and in the xml document wherev thei ar referenc like charact escap dtd technolog is still us in mani applic becaus of it ubiqu xml schema edit main articl xml schema w c a newer schema languag describ by the w c as the successor of dtd is xml schema often refer to by the initi for xml schema instanc xsd xml schema definit xsd ar far more power than dtd in describ xml languag thei us a rich datatyp system and allow for more detail constraint on an xml

xml base defin the xml base attribut which mai be us to set the base for resolut of rel uri refer within the scope of a singl xml element the xml inform set or xml infoset describ an abstract data

standard exist api for xml process tend to fall into these categori stream orient api access from a program languag for exampl sax and stax tree travers api access from a program languag for exampl dom xml data bind which provid an autom translat between an xml document and program languag object declar transform languag such as xslt and xqueri stream orient facil requir less memori and for certain task which ar base on a linear travers of an xml document ar faster and simpler than other altern tree travers and data bind api typic requir the us of much more memori but ar often found more conveni for us by programm some includ declar retriev of document compon via the us of xpath express xslt is design for declar descript of xml document transform and ha been wide implement both in

which a document is read serial and it content ar report as callback to variou method on a handler object of the user s design sax is fast and effici to implement but difficult to us for extract

handl the same wai no matter where thei occur in the document pull pars edit pull pars treat the document as a seri of item which ar read in sequenc us the iter design pattern thi allow for write of recurs descent parser in which the structur of the code perform the pars mirror the structur of the xml be pars and intermedi pars result can be us and access as local variabl within the method perform the pars or pass down as method paramet into lower level method or return as method return valu to higher level method exampl of pull parser includ stax in the java program languag xmlpullpars in smalltalk xmlreader in php elementtre iterpars in python system xml xmlreader in the net framework and the dom travers api nodeiter and treewalk a pull parser creat an iter that sequenti visit the variou element attribut and data in an xml document code which us thi iter can test the current item to tell for exampl whether it is a start or end element or text and inspect it attribut local name namespac valu of xml attribut valu of text etc and can also move the iter to the next item the code can thu extract inform from the document as it travers it the recurs descent approach tend to lend itself to keep data as type local variabl in the code do the pars while sax for instanc typic requir a parser to manual maintain intermedi data within a stack of element which ar parent element of the element be pars pull pars code can be more straightforward to understand and maintain than sax pars code document object model edit the document object model dom is an interfac orient applic program
