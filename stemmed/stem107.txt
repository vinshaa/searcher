regress test from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navig search regress test is a type of softwar test that seek to uncov new softwar bug or regress in exist function and non function area of a system after chang such as enhanc patch or configur chang have been made to them the purpos of regress test is to ensur that chang such as those mention abov have not introduc new fault on of the main reason for regress test is to determin whether a chang in on part of the softwar affect other part of the softwar common method of regress test includ rerun previous complet test and check whether program behavior ha chang and whether previous fix fault have re emerg regress test can be perform to test a system effici by systemat select the appropri minimum set of test need to adequ cover a particular chang contrast with non regress test usual valid test for a new issu which aim to verifi whether after introduc or updat a given softwar applic the chang ha had the intend effect content background us see also refer extern link background edit experi ha shown that as softwar is fix emerg of new fault and or re emerg of old fault is quit common sometim re emerg occur becaus a fix get lost through poor revis control practic or simpl human error in revis control often a fix for a problem will be fragil in that it fix the problem in the narrow case where it wa first observ but not in more gener case which mai aris over the lifetim of the softwar frequent a fix for a problem in on area inadvert caus a softwar bug in anoth area final it mai happen that when some featur is redesign some of the same mistak that were made in the origin implement of the featur ar made in the redesign therefor in most softwar develop situat it is consid good code practic when a bug is locat and fix to record a test that expos the bug and re run that test regularli after subsequ chang to the program although thi mai be done through manual test procedur us program techniqu it is often done us autom test tool such a test suit contain softwar tool that allow the test environ to execut all the regress test case automat some project even set up autom system to automat re run all regress test at specifi interv and report ani failur which could impli a regress or an out of date test common strategi ar to run such a system after everi success compil for small project everi night or onc a week those strategi can be autom by an extern tool regress test is an integr part of the extrem program softwar develop method in thi method design document ar replac by extens repeat and autom test of the entir softwar packag throughout each stage of the softwar develop process in the corpor world regress test ha tradition been perform by a softwar qualiti assur team after the develop team ha complet work howev defect found at thi stage ar the most costli to fix thi problem is be address by the rise of unit test although develop have alwai written test case as part of the develop cycl these test case have gener been either function test or unit test that verifi onli intend outcom develop test compel a develop to focu on unit test and to includ both posit and neg test case us edit regress test can be us not onli for test the correct of a program but often also for track the qualiti of it output for instanc in the design of a compil regress test could track the code size and the time it take to compil and execut the test suit case also as a consequ of the introduct of new bug program mainten requir far more system test per statement written than ani other program theoret after each fix on must run the entir batch of test case previous run against the system to ensur that it ha not been damag in an obscur wai in practic such regress test must inde approxim thi theoret idea and it is veri costli fred brook the mythic man month p regress test can be broadli categor as function test or unit test function test exercis the complet program with variou input unit test exercis individu function subroutin or object method both function test tool and unit test tool tend to be third parti product that ar not part of the compil suit and both tend to be autom a function test mai be a script seri of program input possibl even involv an autom mechan for control mous movement and click a unit test mai be a set of separ function within the code itself or a driver layer
