when error error handler around protect statement the more tradit but less eleg on error statement lack such context or scope on of hp basic s more innov featur is built in support for openvm s power record manag servic rm befor vax basic as it wa then call you would onli get nativ rm support in dec s cobol compil histori edit hp basic for openvm ha gone through mani name chang it began at dec which wa bought by compaq who then merg with hp sinc the compani name is embed in the product name each new owner chang the product name it ha also been port to a success of new platform as thei were develop by dec compaq hp over a period of more than year basic plu edit main articl basic plu hp basic began as basic plu creat by dec for their rst oper system and pdp minicomput program languag statement could either be type into the command interpret directli or enter into a text editor save to a file and then load into the command interpret from the file error in sourc code were report to the user immedi after the line wa enter program were store as a ba sourc file us the save command it could be compil into a non edit binari bac file us the compil command thi command did not produc true machin languag program but rather a byte code call token the token were interpret upon execut in a manner similar to the more modern java program were enter into the command interpret start with line number integ from to line could be continu onto multipl line by us a line feed charact for eas of extern edit of the sourc file later version of basic plu also allow the charact as a line continu charact multipl statement could be place on a singl line us as the statement separ for pdp system with virtual memori rst e address space wa limit to about kb with basic plu about half of thi wa us by the combin command interpret and run time librari thi limit user program to about kb of memori older rst system lack virtual memori so the user program had to fit into whatev wa left of physic memori after rst and basic plu took up their share for exampl on a pdp with k of physic memori run rst v b user program were limit to kb larg program could be broken up into variou piec by us of the chain instruct program could chain to specif line number in a secondari program the us of a share memori section call core common also allow program to pass data among each other as need disk file could also be us but were slower the interpret includ a garbag collect memori manag us for both string data and byte code a run program could be interrupt have variabl examin and modifi and then be resum mani of the control structur us in other high level languag exist in basic plu includ while and until the languag also support the us of condit modifi on a singl line for exampl the line print i unless i would print the valu of i unless i wa less than basic plu edit basic plu bp or basic plu wa later develop by dec to add addit featur and increas perform it us true compil into thread code and wrote it output to machin languag object file these were compat with other object file on the system and could be assembl into librari a linker the tkb taskbuild then creat execut file from them tkb also support overlai thi allow individu routin to be swap into the main memori space as need bp program ran under rsx or rst e s rsx run time system thi rt onli occupi kb later kb of the user s address space leav kb for the user s program these two factor allow individu bp program to be much larger than basic plu program often elimin the need for chain unlik basic plu which wa onli avail on rst bp allow us on the rsx oper system as well vax basic and dec basic edit with the creation of the vax minicomput dec port basic plu to the new vm oper system and call it vax basic vax basic us the standard vm call standard so object code produc by vax basic could be link with object code produc by ani of the other vm languag sourc code for basic plu would usual run without major chang on vax basic when dec creat their alpha microprocessor vm wa port to it and renam openvm vax basic wa likewis port to alpha and renam dec basic the basic interpret wa perman drop at thi point which meant that dec basic program could onli be run as openvm execut produc by a compil follow by a link compaq and hp edit when dec wa purchas by compaq in the product were renam compaq basic for openvm vax and compaq basic for openvm alpha likewis when compaq merg with hp in the product were renam hp basic for openvm on vax and hp basic for openvm on alphaserv hp ha sinc built new server platform base upon
