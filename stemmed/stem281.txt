facto standard dialect of pascal programm borland pascal and later delphi from version on the delphi compat ha been continu implement or improv in fact the project ha a compil mode concept and the develop made it clear that thei would incorpor work patch for the ansi iso standard dialect to creat a standard compliant mode a small effort ha been made to support some of the appl pascal syntax to eas interfac to mac os and mac os x sinc the appl dialect implement some standard pascal featur that turbo pascal and delphi omit free pascal is a bit more iso compat than these the x releas seri doe not significantli chang the dialect object beyond delphi instead thei aim for closer compat the project still lack the delphi function of compil support export of class from share librari which is for exampl us for lazaru which implement packag of compon as of updat sever delphi specif featur have been ad in the current develop branch and some of the start work for the featur new in delphi most notabl the addit of the unicodestr type ha been done the develop branch also featur an object pascal extens for object c cocoa interfac the current trunk version implement basic iso pascal mode though mani thing such as get and put procedur and file buffer variabl concept for file handl ar still miss histori edit the earli year edit free pascal emerg when borland made it clear that borland pascal develop for ms do would stop with version to be replac by a window onli product which becam delphi later on student florian paul klämpfl start develop hi own compil written in the turbo pascal dialect and produc bit code for the go v extend which wa us and develop by the djgpp project at that time origin the compil itself wa a bit do execut compil by turbo pascal after two year the compil wa abl to compil itself and becam a bit execut expans edit the initi bit compil wa publish on the internet and the first contributor join the project later a linux port wa made by michael van canneyt five year befor kylix becam avail the do port wa adapt for us in os us the emx extend which made os the second support compil target apart from support of florian klämpfl as the origin author daniël mantion contribut significantli to make thi happen and provid the origin port of the run time librari to os emx the compil improv gradual and the ms do version migrat to the go v extend thi culmin in releas which wa much more wide us than previou version and wa the last releas aim onli for turbo pascal complianc later releas ad a delphi compat mode thi releas wa also port to system us a x processor with releas the win target wa ad and a start wa made with incorpor some delphi featur stabil for a non beta releas began and version wa releas in juli the x seri wa wide us both as an enterpris and educ tool for the x releas the port to k cpu wa redon and the compil produc stabl code for a number of k unix and amigao oper system the second gener edit dure the stabil of what would becom x and special when port to the motorola k system it wa clear that the design of the code gener wa far too limit in mani wai the princip problem were that ad processor basic meant rewrit the code gener and that the regist alloc wa base on the principl of alwai keep three free regist between build block which wa inflex and hard to maintain for these reason the x branch from the x main branch in decemb at first chang were mostli clean up and rewrit design to all part of the compil and then the code gener and regist alloc were rewritten as a bonu remain miss delphi compat wa ad the work on x continu slowli but steadili and in late a work powerpc port becam avail follow by an arm port in summer a sparc port in fall and an amd port which made the compil avail for a bit platform in earli in novemb a first beta releas of the x branch wa packag and number these were quickli follow by version and version introduc mac os x support the work continu with version januari late februari mai decemb and august consolid the x releas seri edit in some of the major rework plan for such as the rewrit of the unit system had not start and it wa decid to start stabil the alreadi implement featur some of the motiv for thi roadmap chang were the need of the lazaru project particularli the intern linker support for win window ce and mac os x on x and relat featur like dwarf after beta and version wa releas in septemb follow by version in august and version in march the x seri vastli improv the activex com interfac and ol support though bug ar still be found the deleg to interfac us the implement keyword is partial implement but wa not complet as of march updat librari support for activex wa also improv anoth major highlight wa the intern linker for win win and window ce which much improv link time and memori us and make the compil link run cycl in lazaru much faster the effici for smart link or dead code elimin ha also been improv minor new featur ar improv dwarf debug format support and optim such as tail recurs omiss of unneed stack frame and regist base cse optim a first implement of gener support is also avail but onli for explor purpos the x releas seri edit the x releas seri had a less clear set of goal than earlier releas the unit system rewrit wa postpon again and the branch that becam wa creat to keep riski commit from to stabil it mostli these riski commit were more involv improv to the new platform mac powerpc mac x iphon and mani fix to the arm and x architectur in gener as well as dwarf other compil improv includ whole program optim wpo and devirtu and arm eabi support later dure the cycl a more delphi like resourc support base on special section in the binari instead of pascal constant wa ad thi featur dire need by lazaru becam the main highlight of the branch other more minor point were a memori manag that improv heap manag perform in thread environ small improv in delphi compat such as olevari and improv in interfac deleg free pascal wa releas on januari follow by bug fix releas on novemb contain support for for in loop and seal and abstract class and other chang the x releas seri edit in januari free pascal wa releas thi first version from the releas seri also support object pascal on mac os x and io target and implement numer small improv and bug fix fpc wa releas in februari it contain netbsd and openbsd releas for the first time sinc
