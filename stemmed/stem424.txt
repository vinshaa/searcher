compos of antiparticl which have the same mass as particl of ordinari matter but have opposit charg and other particl properti such as lepton and baryon number quantum spin etc collis between particl and antiparticl lead to the annihil of both give rise to variabl proport of intens photon gamma rai neutrino and less massiv particl antiparticl pair the mass of ani produc neutrino is neglig while thei contain energi that gener continu to be unavail after the releas of particl antiparticl annihil the total consequ of annihil is a releas of energi avail for work proport to the total matter and antimatt mass in accord with the mass energi equival equat e mc antiparticl bind with each other to form antimatt just as ordinari particl bind to form normal matter for exampl a positron the antiparticl of the electron and an antiproton can form an antihydrogen atom physic principl indic that complex antimatt atom nuclei ar possibl as well as anti atom correspond to the known chemic

noth citat need there is consider specul as to why the observ univers is compos almost entir of ordinari matter as oppos to a more even mixtur of matter and antimatt thi asymmetri of matter and antimatt in the visibl univers is on of the great unsolv problem in physic the process by which thi inequ between particl and antiparticl develop is call baryogenesi antimatt in the form of anti atom is on of the most difficult materi to produc antimatt in the form of individu anti particl howev is commonli produc by particl acceler and in some type of radioact decai the nuclei of antihelium both

theoret propos mere specul and like the previou idea differ from the modern concept of antimatt in that it possess neg graviti the modern theori of antimatt began in with a paper by paul dirac dirac realis that hi relativist version of the schrödinger wave equat for electron predict the possibl of antielectron these were discov by carl d anderson in and name positron a portmanteau of posit electron although dirac did not himself us the term antimatt it us follow on natur enough from antielectron antiproton etc a complet period tabl of antimatt wa envisag by charl janet in the feynman
