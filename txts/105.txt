Khronos members may contribute to the development of Khronos API specifications, vote at various stages before public deployment, and accelerate delivery of their platforms and applications through early access to specification drafts and conformance tests. On 31 July 2006, it was announced at SIGGRAPH that control of the OpenGL specification would be passed to the group.[1][2]    Contents  1 History2 Working Groups3 Members 3.1 Promoters3.2 Contributors3.3 Academic Contributors3.4 Past members 4 References5 External links   History[edit] The Khronos Group was founded in 2000 by companies including ATI Technologies, Discreet, Evans & Sutherland, Intel Corporation, NVIDIA, Silicon Graphics (SGI), and Sun Microsystems. It now has roughly 100 member companies, over 30 adopters, and 24 conforming members.[3] Its president is Neil Trevett. Working Groups[edit] COLLADA, a file-format intended to facilitate interchange of 3D assets.EGL, an interface between Khronos rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native platform window system[4]OpenCL, a cross-platform computation API.[5]OpenGL, a cross-platform computer graphics APIOpenGL ES, a derivative of OpenGL for use on mobile and embedded systems, such as cell phones, portable gaming devices, and moreOpenGL SC, a safety critical profile of OpenGL ES designed to meet the needs of the safety-critical marketOpenKCam, Advanced Camera Control APIOpenKODE, an API for providing abstracted, portable access to operating system resources such as file systems, networks and math librariesOpenMAX, a layered set of three programming interfaces of various abstraction levels, providing access to multimedia functionalityOpenML, an API for capturing, transporting, processing, displaying, and synchronizing digital mediaOpenSL ES, an audio API tuned for embedded systems, standardizing access to features such as 3D positional audio and MIDI playbackOpenVG, an API for accelerating processing of 2D vector graphics.OpenVX, Hardware acceleration API for Computer Vision applications and librariesOpenWF, APIs for 2D graphics composition and display controlSPIR, a intermediate compiler target for OpenCL and VulkanStreamInput, an API for consistently handling input devices.Vulkan, a low-overhead computer graphics APIWebCL, a JavaScript binding to OpenCL within a browser.WebGL, a JavaScript binding to OpenGL ES within a browser on any platform supporting the OpenGL or OpenGL ES graphics standards Members[edit] Khronos group divides its members followingly:[6] Academic Contributors - have full API working group participation but no voting rights.Contributors - have full API working group participation and voting rights, and generous marketing benefits.Promoters - act as the "Board of Directors" to set the direction of the Group, with final specification ratification voting rights.
