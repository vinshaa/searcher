The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform was developed by JBoss, now a division of Red Hat.

Licensing and pricing[edit] JBoss itself is open source, but Red Hat charges to provide a support subscription for JBoss Enterprise Middleware. Related products[edit] These products are part of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware portfolio of software,[3] or are included with the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform software.[7] JBoss Enterprise Web Platform (or JBoss EWP) This software is a lighter weight version of the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. The key components are essentially the same as the full JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, but uses a slimmed down profile of the JBoss Application Server.[8] Lists of components[9] and standards supported[10] are available.JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform (or JBoss EPP) This software is an enterprise portal with the core portal features of presentation, master page objects, containers, and a repository, and also an optional site publisher.[11] Key components:[12] JBoss Enterprise Application Platform – the software infrastructureGateIn Portal – both an enterprise web portal and also a portal framework to build upon.[13][14][15][16] GateIn Portal includes support for Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP), Java Content Repository (JCR), Single Sign-On (SSO), and OpenSocial gadgets.JBoss Portlet Bridge – a non-final draft implementation of the JSR-301 and JSR-329 specifications that support JavaServer Faces (JSF) within a JSR-286 portlet. This software also supports other web frameworks such as JBoss Seam and RichFaces to run inside a portlet.[17][18]Site Publisher – web content management (optional) (by eXo)  JBoss EPP implements the standards for Portlet 2.0 (JSR-286), JCR (JSR-170), OASIS WSRP 1.0, and OpenSocial.[19]A list of components[20] is available.The GateIn project is a merge of JBoss Portal 2.7 and eXo Portal 2.5 that produced GateIn Portal 3.0, and also the related projects GateIn Portlet Container, eXo JCR, and JBoss Portlet Bridge.[21][22][23][24] JBoss Enterprise Web Server (or JBoss EWS) This software is a platform for lightweight Java applications, but also handles large scale websites.[25] JBoss EWS may be deployed as a standard enterprise web server, a simple Java application server, or an enterprise open source application infrastructure.[26] Key components: Apache Tomcat – including Java Servlet and JavaServer PagesApache Web Server – including common modules and connectors for authentication, caching, proxying, filtering, and load balancing (mod_jk)  Lists of components[27] and standards supported[28] are available. JBoss Web Framework Kit This software is a set of web frameworks used for building light and rich Java applications. Components:[29] Google Web Toolkit – framework for rich Internet applicationsRichFaces – framework for rich Internet applicationsSpring Framework – Java frameworkApache Struts – Java framework JBoss Cache (or JBC) This software implements a cache for frequently accessed Java objects to improve application performance. The cache can be replicated and transactional. The cache can be replicated across one or more Java Virtual Machines (JVM) across a network. The cache can be transactional because a JTA compliant transaction manager can be configured and make any cache interaction transactional. The two types of JBoss Cache are Core and POJO, with the POJO library built on top the Core library.[30]JBoss Netty This software is a New I/O (NIO) client-server framework for the development of Java network applications such as protocol servers and clients. The asynchronous event-driven network application framework and tools is used to simplify network programming such as TCP and UDP socket servers.[31] Netty includes an implementation of the reactor pattern of programming.
