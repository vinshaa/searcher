(Aléxandros), meaning "Defender of the people" or "Defending men"[1] and also, "Protector of men", a compound of the verb ??????? alexein, "to ward off, to avert, to defend"[2] and the noun ???? an?r, "man" (GEN ?????? andros).[3] It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek (or Indo-European more generally) names expressing "battle-prowess", in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy battle line.[citation needed] The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek feminine anthroponym ??????, a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (transcribed as Alexandra), written in the Linear B syllabic script.[4][5][6] The name was one of the titles ("epithets") given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". In the Iliad, the character Paris is known also as Alexander.[7] The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of King Alexander III, commonly known as "Alexander the Great". Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named for him.[citation needed] People known as Alexander[edit] Alexander has been the name of many rulers, including kings of Macedon, of Scotland, emperors of Russia and popes.
