Zeus Web Server                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Zeus Web Server is a proprietary web server for Unix and Unix-like platforms (currently Solaris, FreeBSD, HP-UX and Linux). It was developed by Zeus Technology, a software company located in Cambridge, England. The original authors and company founders are University of Cambridge graduates Damian Reeves and Adam Twiss. Support for AIX, Tru64, and Mac OS X was dropped on 10 June 2008.[1] ZWS hasn't been updated since January 2010,[2] and the company no longer offers a similar server solution. In July 2011, the company was acquired by Riverbed Technology[3] and ended product support November 30, 2014.[4] Zeus is designed to be a high-performance web server[5] and was commonly used by hardware vendors submitting SPECweb99 benchmarks for their hardware.[6] The SPECweb99 benchmark was retired in 2005 and replaced by SPECweb2005.[7] While some SPECweb2005 submissions were made using Zeus, as of 2008 it is no longer among the top performers.[8] In addition to static content serving, Zeus supports dynamic content via CGI, FastCGI, Apache JServ, ISAPI, NSAPI, mod_perl, SSI and Zeus Distributed Authentication and Content (ZDAC), a proprietary FastCGI-like protocol. While Zeus mainly competes with other commercial web servers such as Oracle iPlanet Web Server, it also claims a high degree of compatibility with Apache HTTP Server (e.g. .htaccess and mod rewrite), with the expectation that Apache users will migrate to Zeus as their server load increases.[9] NSAPI and ISAPI are supported to ease migrations from Microsoft IIS and Sun Java System Web Server.
