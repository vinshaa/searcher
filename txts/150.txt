(February 2008) Client-side refers to operations that are performed by the client in a client–server relationship in a computer network. Typically, a client is a computer application, such as a web browser, that runs on a user's local computer or workstation and connects to a server as necessary. Operations may be performed client-side because they require access to information or functionality that is available on the client but not on the server, because the user needs to observe them or provide input, or because the server lacks the processing power to perform the operations in a timely manner for all of the clients it serves. Additionally, if operations can be performed by the client, without sending data over the network, they may take less time, use less bandwidth, and incur a lesser security risk. When the server serves data in a commonly used manner, for example according to the HTTP or FTP protocols, users may have their choice of a number of client server-side operation) and sends it back to the client. The client then analyzes the data (a client-side operation), and, when the analysis is complete, transmits its results back to the server.
