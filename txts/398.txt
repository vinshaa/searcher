Armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO's Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Trade Organization and La Francophonie. It is also an observer member of the Eurasian Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement. Eduard Nalbandyan serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia.

Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian genocide include Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden,[2] Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela; additionally, some regional governments of countries recognize the Armenian genocide too, such as New South Wales in Australia and Wales in the United Kingdom. US House Resolution 106 was introduced on 30 January 2007, and later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill has 225 co-sponsors.[3] The bill called for former President George W. Bush to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual 24 April speech which he never used. His successor President Barack Obama has expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word genocide in his first annual 24 April speech in 2009 and ever since. Disputes[edit] Nagorno-Karabakh/ Independent Republic[edit] See also: Nagorno-Karabakh conflict Armenia supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the longstanding and very bitter conflict against the Azerbaijani Government. The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh and later in Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan and ethnic Azeris in Armenia. In 1990, after violent episodes in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijani cities like Baku, Sumgait and Kirovabad, Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and forcibly occupied Baku, killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian populations in Karabakh, known as Operation Ring. Moscow also deployed troops to Yerevan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, conflict escalated into a full-scale war between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, supported, by Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Military action was influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring sides in order to keep both under control.[citation needed] More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1988 to 1994. In May 1992, ethnic Armenian forces seized Shusha and Lachin (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, ethnic Armenian forces succeeded in taking almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the UN Security Council adopted four resolutions calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when Russia brokered a cease-fire, between the three sides. Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, sniper-fire and landmine incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.[citation needed] Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in Key West, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell launched the talks on 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace. The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of Armenian descent, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.[4][5] In 2008, in what became known as the 2008 Mardakert Skirmishes, ethnic Armenia forces and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.[6]  Countries with no diplomatic relations[edit] Armenia does not have diplomatic relations with the following countries:  Azerbaijan Hungary (suspended by Armenia since 31 August 2012 due to Ramil Safarov's extradition to Azerbaijan)[7][8] Pakistan (Pakistan does not recognize Armenia) Palestinian Authority (Armenia does not recognize the State of Palestine) Saudi Arabia Turkey Western Sahara Yemen Countries with diplomatic relations[edit]     Foreign relations of Armenia:   Diplomatic relations established   No diplomatic relations established   Diplomatic relations suspended by Armenia    Armenia has diplomatic relations with 151 sovereign entities (including the Vatican City and Order of Malta).[9] These include: Albania, Afghanistan, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bhutan,[10] Bangladesh,Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chad, Chile, the People's Republic of China, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, DR Congo,[11] Egypt, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada,[12] Holy See (Vatican City), Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, North Korea, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Libya, Macedonia,[13][14] Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Myanmar,[15] Norway, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Order of Malta, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sudan, Swaziland,[16] Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu,[17] Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Uruguay and Vietnam.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Armenia has not yet established diplomatic relations with: AzerbaijanSt. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, BarbadosCape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Niger, Togo, Central African Republic, S?o Tomé and Príncipe, South Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda, Comoros, Mauritius, Lesotho, BotswanaPakistan, Saudi Arabia, YemenPalau, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New GuineaTurkeythe states with limited recognition.

Since the independence of Armenia the two countries have been partners within the framework of international organizations (United Nations, OSCE, Council of Europe, BSEC), whilst Greece firmly supports the community programs aimed at further developing relations between the EU and Armenia. Continuous visits of the highest level have shown that both countries want to continue to improve the levels of friendship and cooperation (Visit by the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian to Greece in 1996, visit by the President of the Hellenic Republic Costis Stephanopoulos in 1999, visit by the President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan to Greece in 2000 and 2005 and visit by Greek president Karolos Papoulias to Armenia in June 2007). Greece is, after Russia, the major military partner of Armenia. Armenian officers are trained in Greek military academies, and various technical assistance is supplied by Greece. Since 2003, an Armenian platoon has been deployed in Kosovo as part of KFOR, where they operate as a part of the Greek battalion of KFOR.  Holy See000000001992-05-23-000023 May 1992See Armenia–Holy See relations Hungary000000001992-02-26-000026 Feb 1992 — 31 Aug 2012 See Armenia–Hungary relations Armenia was represented in Hungary through its embassy in Vienna (Austria).Hungary was represented in Armenia through its embassy in Tbilisi(Georgia) and an honorary consulate in Yerevan.[35]There are around 15,000 people of Armenian descent living in Hungary.  IcelandSee Armenia–Iceland relations Ireland000000001996-06-13-000013 Jun 1996See Armenia–Ireland relations Ireland recognized Armenia's independence in December 1991.Armenia is represented in Ireland through its embassy in London and through an honorary consulate in Dublin.[36]Ireland is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Sofia (Bulgaria) and through an honorary consulate in Yerevan.Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe.[37]  Italy000000001993-05-12-000012 May 1993See Armenia–Italy relations Armenia has an embassy in Rome.[38]Italy has an embassy in Yerevan and an honorary consulate in Gyumri.[39]Italy has recognized the Armenian Genocide in 2000.There are around 4,000 people of Armenian descent living in Italy.  Latvia000000001992-08-22-000022 Aug 1992See Armenia–Latvia relations Armenia is represented in Latvia through its embassy in Vilnius (Lithuania).Latvia is represented in Armenia through a non-resident ambassador based in Riga (at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and through an honorary consulate in Yerevan.There are around 5,000 people of Armenian descent living in Latvia.Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about relations with Armenia[dead link]Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction if the Latvian representation in Armenia[dead link]  Liechtenstein000000002008-05-07-00007 May 2008See Armenia–Liechtenstein relations Lithuania000000001991-11-21-000021 Nov 1991See Armenia–Lithuania relations Armenia has an embassy in Vilnius.Lithuania has an embassy in Yerevan.There are around 2,500 people of Armenian descent living in Lithuania.Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign affairs: list of bilateral treaties with Armenia (in Lithuanian only)  Luxembourg000000001992-06-11-000011 Jun 1992See Armenia–Luxembourg relations Armenia is represented in Luxembourg through its embassy in Brussels, (Belgium), and an honorary consulate in Luxembourg.  Macedonia000000001993-04-27-000027 Apr 1993[13]See Armenia–Macedonia relations Malta000000001993-05-27-000027 May 1993See Armenia–Malta relations Armenia is represented in Malta through its embassy in Rome.Malta is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Warsaw and honorary consulate in Yerevan.  Moldova000000001992-05-01-0000May 1992See Armenia–Moldova relations Armenia is represented in Moldova through its embassy in Kiev (Ukraine).Moldova is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia).There are around 8,000 people of Armenina descent living in Moldova.Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: presentation of the Moldovan ambassador’s credentials to the Armenian Foreign Minister[dead link]Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs: list of bilateral treaties with Armenia  Monaco000000002008-10-01-0000Oct 2008See Armenia–Monaco relations MontenegroSee Armenia–Montenegro relations Netherlands000000001992-01-30-000030 Jan 1992See Armenia–Netherlands relations Armenia has an embassy in The Hague and honorary consulate in HilversumThe Netherlands is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia. Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev's US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development. However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.  San Marino000000002006-03-21-000021 Mar 2006See Armenia–San Marino relations Armenia is represented in San Marino through its embassy in Rome (Italy)  Serbia000000001993-01-14-000014 Jan 1993See Armenia–Serbia relations Armenia is represented in Serbia through its embassy in Athens (Greece).Serbia is also represented in Armenia through its embassy in Athens.Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about relations with Armenia[dead link]  Slovakia000000001993-01-14-000014 Jan 1993See Armenia–Slovakia relations Armenia is represented in Slovakia through its embassy in Prague (Czech Republic).Slovakia is represented in Armenia through a non resident ambassador based in Bratislava (in the Foreign Ministry).Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and of the Council of Europe.Between 24–28 February 2008, Slovak Foreign Minister Ján Kubiš made an official visit to Armenia.[47]  Slovenia000000001994-06-27-000027 Jun 1994See Armenia–Slovenia relations Spain000000001992-01-27-000027 Jan 1992See Armenia–Spain relations Armenia has an embassy in Madrid[48] and there is an 2 honorary consulates in Valencia and Barcelona.Spain is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia) and an honorary consulate in Yerevan.Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperations about the relation with Armenia (in Spanish only)  Sweden000000001992-07-10-000010 Jul 1992See Armenia–Sweden relations Armenia has an embassy in Stockholm.Sweden opened an embassy in Yerevan 2014. and an honorary consulate in Yerevan.[49]Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: informations about the Swedish ambassador to Armenia   Switzerland000000001991-12-23-000023 Dec 1991See Armenia–Switzerland relations The Armenian ambassador to Switzerland and the Swiss ambassador to Armenia (based in Yerevan, Armenia) were both accredited in 2011.The Armenian ambassador to Switzerland is based in Geneva, in the Armenian representation to the United Nations.Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs about relations with Armenia  Ukraine000000001992-12-25-000025 Dec 1992See Armenia–Ukraine relations Armenian-Ukrainian relations have lasted for centuries and today are cordial.

The British government states the "massacres were an appalling tragedy" and states that this was the view of the government during that period.[53] Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland consider it to be a genocide, and there is a memorial in Cardiff, Wales.British Foreign and Commonwealth Office about relations with Armenia  Asia[edit] CountryFormal relations beganNotes AzerbaijanNo diplomatic relationsSee Armenia–Azerbaijan relations, Nagorno-Karabakh War, Sumgait pogrom, Baku pogrom, Khojaly Massacre, Maraga massacre, Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War) and in 1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War), in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived in relative peace under the Soviet iron fist. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) of the Azerbaijan SSR began a movement to unify with the Armenian SSR. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The violence resulted in de facto Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when the three sides agreed to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 the sides also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by the U.S., France and Russia, and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.[citation needed] The sides are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of Armenian descent, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.[5] If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden to enter the Republic of Azerbaijan.[54] In 2008, in what became known as the 2008 Mardakert Skirmishes, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the three sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.[6]  Bhutan000000002012-09-27-000027 Sep 2012See Armenia–Bhutan relations China000000001992-04-06-00006 Apr 1992See Armenia–China relations China recognized Armenia on 21 December 1991.Armenia has an embassy in Beijing.China has an embassy in Yerevan.[55]Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, cultural exchange has been a major component of bilateral relations, as both nations recognize the importance of creating a strong foundation based upon their ancient and rich histories.[56]  Cyprus000000001992-03-18-000018 Mar 1992See Armenia–Cyprus relations Cyprus was the second country to recognise the Armenian Genocide, on 24 April 1975.Armenia is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Athens (Greece).Cyprus is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia), and through an honorary consulate in Yerevan.There are over 3.500 people of Armenian descent living in Cyprus.[57]Vahan Ovanesyan of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation visited Cyprus on 24 January 2001 to take part in celebrations of the 110th anniversary of the federation.[58]Cyprus Foreign Ministry: list of bilateral treaties with Armenia  Georgia000000001992-07-17-000017 Jul 1992See Armenia–Georgia relations Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common. Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms "Apostolic" and "Orthodox" in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term "Catholicos" to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals). Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing Karabakh conflict, Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its Black Sea ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the 2008 South Ossetia war and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and South Caucasus natural gas pipeline) have also weighed on the mutual relations. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, "We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia."[59] However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve. On 10 May 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.[60] The Javakheti region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United Javakhk) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.  India000000001992-08-31-000031 Aug 1992See Armenia–India relations Since 1999, Armenia has an embassy in New Delhi and two honorary consulates Mumbai, and Chennai.India has an embassy in Yerevan.[61]Indian government is funding the renovation of schools in Lori region.Around 700 Medical students are studying in Armenian universities.Armenia recognizes Kashmir to be part of India and not of Pakistan.Armenia supports India's bid for permanent seat in the UNSC.[62]  IranSee Armenia–Iran relations Despite religious and ideological differences, relations between Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran remain cordial and both Armenia and Iran are strategic partners in the region. Armenia and Iran enjoy cultural and historical ties that go back thousands of years. There are no border disputes between the two countries and the Christian Armenian minority in Iran enjoys official recognition. Of special importance is the cooperation in the field of energy security which lowers Armenia's dependence on Russia and can in the future also supply Iranian gas to Europe through Georgia and the Black Sea.  IsraelSee Armenia–Israel relations Since independence, Armenia has received support from Israel and today remains one of its major trade partners. While both countries have diplomatic relations, neither maintains an embassy in the other country. Instead, Ehude Moshe Eytam, the Israeli ambassador to Armenia is based in Tbilisi, Georgia, and visits Yerevan twice a month.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Armenia announced that it would send humanitarian aid to Lebanon. According to the Armenian government, an unspecified amount of medicines, tents and fire-fighting equipment was allocated to Lebanese authorities on 27 July 2006.[64][65]  MalaysiaArmenia-Malaysia relations has an the embassy in New Delhi.

The main issue is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Pakistan is a major supporter of Azerbaijan during and after the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Pakistan also does not recognize Armenia despite Armenia recognizing Pakistan. Pakistan does not recognize the Armenian Genocide and maintains that during the war large number of Armenians and Muslims were killed. Armenia also has friendly relations with India, which Pakistan heavily opposes.  Philippines000000001992-05-20-000020 May 1992See Armenia–Philippines relations The Philippines has a consulate in Yerevan.Armenia has a consulate in Makati.  Sri Lanka000000001992-02-12-000012 Feb 1992See Armenia–Sri Lanka relations Armenia is represented in Sri Lanka through the Embassy of Armenia in New Delhi.Sri Lanka is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia) and an honorary consulate in Yerevan.  Saudi ArabiaSee Armenia–Saudi Arabia relations There are no diplomatic relations between Armenia and Saudi Arabia.[67]  South Korea21 February 1992[68]See Armenia–South Korea relations South Korea–Armenia relations Armenian–South Korean relations South Korean–Armenian relations The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Hayastani Hanrapetutyun (Republic of Armenia) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) began on 21 February 1992.The Republic of Korea and the Republic of Armenia Policy Consultation will deal with ways to vitalize high-level exchanges promote substantive cooperation and work together on regional and global issues.[69]The Republic of Armenia Armenia has an embassy in seoul South Korea.The Republic of Korea South Korea has an embassy in Yerevan Armenia.Bilateral Trade in 2014 : Exports : $15 million (Textile, Automobile)Imports : $3 million (Animal Feed, Rubber) The number of the South Koreans living in Republic of Armenia in 2012 was about 60.Foreign relations of South Korea#Europe Foreign relations of South Korea Foreign relations of the Republic of Korea.[68]  SyriaSee Armenia–Syria relations Armenia has an embassy in Damascus and a consulate general in Aleppo.[70]Since 1997, Syria has an embassy in Yerevan.There are around 150,000 people of Armenian descent living in the Syria.[citation needed] During the Armenian Genocide, the main killing fields of Armenians were located in the Syrian desert of Deir ez-Zor.Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction of the Syrian embassy in Yerevan[dead link]  TurkeyNo formal diplomatic relationsSee Armenia–Turkey relations Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey's holding of historic Armenian lands[citation needed][dubious – discuss] (ceded to them in the Treaty of Kars, a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire orchestrated by the Young Turks is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide. On 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to "continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions."[71] Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the Armenian SSR, it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.[72] Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official Yerevan is not willing to do. In the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship. According to The Economist magazine, 70% of Armenia's imports enter via Georgia. Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive.[73]  Turkmenistan000000001992-01-01-00001992See Armenia–Turkmenistan relations Armenia has an embassy in Ashgabat.Turkmenistan has an embassy in Yerevan.Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.There are between 32,000 people of Armenian descent living in Turkmenistan.  United Arab EmiratesSee Armenia–United Arab Emirates relations Armenia has an embassy in Abu Dhabi.[74]The United Arab Emirates is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Tehran (Iran).There are around 3,500 people of Armenian descent living in the United Arab Emirates.[75]Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: presentation of the Emirati ambassador’s credentials to the Armenian Foreign Minister[dead link]  Americas and Oceania[edit] CountryFormal relations beganNotes Argentina000000001992-01-17-000017 Jan 1992See Armenia–Argentina relations Argentina is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Yerevan.Armenia has an embassy in Buenos Aires.Argentine parliament has recognized the Armenian Genocide.List of Treaties ruling the relations Argentina and Armenia (Argentine Foreign Ministry, in Spanish)[dead link]  AustraliaSee Armenia–Australia relations The first Armenians migrated to Australia in the 1850s, during the gold rush. The majority came to Australia in the 1960s, starting with the Armenians of Egypt after Nasser came to power then, in the early 1970s, from Cyprus after the Turkish occupation of the island and from 1975 until 1992, a period of civil unrest in Lebanon. Person-to-person governmental links are increasing although they are still modest. In September 2003, The Hon Mr Philip Ruddock MP visited Armenia in his former capacity as Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In October 2005, the Armenian Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr Vardan Oskanyan, visited Australia. In November 2005, The Hon Mr Joe Hockey MP, Minister for Human Services, visited Armenia. The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia refuses to recognise the mass murder of Armenians in 1915 as Genocide, although the State of N.S.W passed a law recognising this several years earlier. The Australian Government elections of 2007 created an atmosphere in which the Opposition Labor party declared it will push for the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Australian Parliament if Labor wins the Elections.  Brazil000000001992-02-17-000017 Feb 1992See Armenia–Brazil relations Brazil has an embassy in Yerevan.Armenia has an embassy in Brasilia and general consulate in S?o Paulo.There are around 45,000 people of Armenian descent living in Brazil.  CanadaSee also Armenia–Canada relations, Embassy of Armenia in Ottawa, Armenian Canadian Armenia has an embassy in Ottawa.[76]Canada is accredited to Armenia from its embassy in Moscow, Russia and an honorary consulate in Yerevan.[77]In 2004, the parliament of Canada recognized the Armenian Genocide.Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade about relations with Armenian  Chile000000001992-01-01-00001992See Armenia–Chile relations Armenia is represented in Chile through its embassy in Buenos Aires (Argentina), and honorary consulate in Santiago.Chile is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia).There are around 1,600 people of Armenian descent living in Chile.
