Netscape Server Application Programming Interface                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          For other uses, see NSAPI. The Netscape Server Application Programming Interface (NSAPI) is an application programming interface for extending server software, typically web server software.

A variant of NSAPI can also be used with Netscape's directory server software. Because there is no formal standard, applications that use NSAPI are not necessarily portable across server software. As of 2007, varying degrees of support for NSAPI are found in Sun Java System Web Server and Zeus Web Server. NSAPI plug-ins[edit] Applications that use NSAPI are referred to as NSAPI plug-ins. Each plug-in implements one or more Server Application Functions (SAFs). To use a SAF, an administrator must first configure the server to load the plug-in that implements that SAF. This is typically controlled by a configuration file named magnus.conf. Once the plug-in is loaded, the administrator can configure when the server should invoke the SAF and what parameters it should be passed. This is typically controlled by a configuration file named obj.conf. Comparison with related APIs and protocols[edit] NSAPI can be compared to an earlier protocol named Common Gateway Interface (CGI). Like CGI, NSAPI provides a means of interfacing application software with a web server. Unlike CGI programs, NSAPI plug-ins run inside the server process. Because CGI programs run outside of the server process, CGI programs are generally slower than NSAPI plug-ins. However, running outside of the server process can improve server reliability by isolating potentially buggy applications from the server software and from each other. In contrast to CGI programs, NSAPI SAFs can be configured to run at different stages of request processing. For example, while processing a single HTTP request, different NSAPI SAFs can be used to authenticate and authorize the remote user, map the requested URI to a local file system path, generate the web page, and log the request. After Netscape introduced NSAPI, Microsoft developed ISAPI and the Apache Software Foundation developed Apache API (or ASAPI: Apache Server API). All three APIs have a number of similarities. For example: NSAPI, ISAPI and Apache API allow applications to run inside the server process. Further, all three allow applications to participate in the different stages of request processing. For example, Apache API hooks closely resemble those used in NSAPI.[1] See also[edit] NPAPI (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) References[edit]  ^ "Apache API notes".   External links[edit] Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.9 NSAPI Developer's GuideSun Java System Web Server 7.0 NSAPI Developer's GuideZeus Web Server Introduction to NSAPI    vte  Web interfaces Server-side   Protocols   CGISCGIFCGIAJPWSRPWebSocket   Server APIs   C NSAPIC ASAPIC ISAPICOM ASPJava servlet container Portlet container CIL System.Web.IHttpHandlerPython WSGIRuby RackJavaScript JSGIPerl PSGILua WSAPIOWIN   Apache modules   mod_jkmod_lispmod_monomod_parrotmod_perlmod_phpmod_proxymod_pythonmod_wsgimod_rubyPhusion Passenger   Topics   Web resource vs. Web serviceOpen APIWebhookApplication server comparison    Client-side   Browser APIs   C NPAPI LiveConnectXPConnect C NPRuntimeC PPAPI NaCl ActiveX   Web APIs    W3C   AudioCanvasCORSFileGeolocationIndexedDBMicrodataSSESVGVideoWebRTCWebSocketWeb messagingWeb storageWeb workerXMLHttpRequest   Khronos   WebCLWebGL   Others   GearsWeb SQL Database (formerly W3C)    Topics   MashupWeb IDL        vte  Netscape Browser versions  Mosaic NetscapeNetscape Navigator 1234 Netscape Communicator 45 Netscape 67 Netscape Browser 8Netscape Navigator 9Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI)  E-mail clients  Netscape Mail & NewsgroupsNetscape Messenger 9  Other components  Netscape Composer  Server software  Netscape Enterprise ServerNetscape Application ServerNetscape Proxy ServerNetscape Directory ServerNetscape Server Application Programming Interface (NSAPI)  Web services  Netscape.comPropeller.comOpen Directory ProjectNetscape ISP  People  Eric J.
