(February 2011) Lazarus Lazarus IDE 1.0 running on Mac OS X Developer(s)Volunteers (Lazarus Team)Stable release1.4.2 / July 14, 2015; 30 days ago (2015-07-14)Development statusActiveWritten inObject PascalOperating systemCross-platform, including Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, SolarisPlatformARM, IA-32, PowerPCAvailable inMulti-languageTypeRAD tool for Pascal and Object PascalLicenseGNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License, and othersWebsitehttp://www.lazarus-ide.org/ Lazarus is a free cross-platform visual integrated development environment (IDE) for rapid application development (RAD) using the Free Pascal compiler, which supports dialects of Object Pascal, to varying degrees. Software developers use Lazarus to create native-code console and graphical user interface (GUI) applications for the desktop, and also for mobile devices, web applications, web services, visual components and function libraries (.so, .dll, etc., for use by other programs). The Free Pascal compiler supports a number of different platforms, such as Mac, Linux and Windows. Lazarus inherits three features from its use of the Free Pascal compiler: compile and execution speed, and cross-compilation. The Free Pascal compiler benefits from the Pascal language structure and the steady advancements of the Pascal compiler design (spanning several decades) to compile large applications quickly, often in a matter of seconds. When compiling reference programs for performance metrics, Lazarus produces programs that exhibit near or similar performance when compared with the same programs written in C. An application that developers create using Lazarus on one platform can potentially compile and execute on any platform for which a Free Pascal compiler exists. The usual caveats of the limitations of the target platform apply; however, for desktop applications a single source can target Mac, Linux, and Windows, usually with no modification (or very little modification). An example application is the Lazarus IDE which itself was created using the Lazarus IDE from a single code base and is available on all major platforms and also runs on the Raspberry PI.

Along with the customary project management features, the Lazarus IDE also provides features that includes but are not limited to: A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) visual windows layout designerAn extensive set of GUI widgets or visual components such as edit boxes, buttons, dialogs, menus, etc.An extensive set of non-visual components for common behaviors such as persistence of application settingsA set of data-connectivity components for MySQL, PostgresSQL, FireBird, Oracle, SQLite, Sybase, and othersData-aware widget set that allows the developer to see data in visual components in the designer to assist with developmentInteractive code debuggerCode completionCode templatesSyntax highlightingContext-sensitive helpText resource manager for internationalizationAutomatic code formattingThe ability to create custom components Cross-platform development[edit]     Interaction of class libraries and widgetsets in Lazarus and Free Pascal   Lazarus uses Free Pascal as its back-end compiler. Therefore, Lazarus can, theoretically, be used to develop applications for all platforms supported by Free Pascal. Similar to Free Pascal’s run-time library, Lazarus provides a cross-platform application framework called the Lazarus Component Library (LCL), which provides a single, unified interface for programmers, with different platform-specific implementations. Using LCL, one can create applications in a write once, compile anywhere manner, unless system-dependent features are used explicitly. Cross-compiling[edit] As Free Pascal supports cross-compiling, Lazarus applications can be cross-compiled from Windows to Linux and FreeBSD, and vice versa. Compiling from Mac OS X to Windows, Linux and FreeBSD is possible. Cross-compiling to Mac OS X could be done for older (PowerPC) versions, but not for newer Intel versions, since Apple no longer releases the assembler and linker sources. Applications for embedded devices (smartphones, PDAs, routers, game consoles) are cross-compiled from a *nix or Windows. With Lazarus 1.3 (development version) it is possible to generate Android applications.[1] Lazarus Component Library[edit]     Architecture of the Lazarus Component Library   The standard application framework, Lazarus Component Library (LCL) was modeled after the Visual Component Library (VCL) in Delphi 6, but it is available for operating systems other than Windows. This is done by separating the definition of common widget classes and their widgetset-specific implementation. Support for each widget set is done by providing an interface which interacts directly with the widget set.[2] Database development[edit] Developers can install packages that allow Lazarus to support several databases. Programs can interact with databases through code or by components dropped on a form. The data-aware components represent fields and are connected by the correct setting of properties to a TDataSource, which represents a table, and to the database components, which may be TPSQLDatabase, TSQLiteDataSet, or equivalent. The following databases are supported out of the box using the built-in database components: dBase and FoxPro can be supported without the need for an external server or library through the TDbf componentInterBase / Firebird. See [1]Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase ASE. See [2]MySQL. See [3]ODBC databases. See [4]Oracle. See [5]PostgreSQL. See [6]SQLite. See [7] Differences from Delphi[edit] While resembling Delphi in many ways, there are a few limitations regarding the performance and feature set. Under Windows executable, by default, file size is somewhat larger than the Delphi (6/7) equivalent because debug information is included within Lazarus executables, instead of as separate files like Delphi. From release 0.9.30 external debug symbols are supported; program file size can be significantly reduced by using an external symbols file (it can be set in Compiler options), or by using StripComponents for Delphi can be installed in Lazarus, but they must be converted, which can be complex (less complex since FP 2.4.x-based 0.9.30)Missing important media libraries and widgets: Microsoft Office connectivity (popping up Excel with a simple table filled out works in 2.5.x trunk)Datasnap (not a publicly documented system, Embarcadero proprietary enterprise functionality) Networking is mostly availableNo support to directly call .NET libraries;. It is possible to call Object Pascal code from .NET software.[3]COM support was missing until version 2.2.0.Missing dynamically loadable packages support.Not 100 percent compatible with VCL. As mentioned previously this is by design, although the current LCL widget set should suffice for most applications. But this makes the deep repository of available VCL widgets inaccessible without conversion. The conversion effort mostly involves some editing, although there are a few fundamental differences. When porting, missing units in the libraries and COM support are a considerably bigger problem than incompatibilities between LCL and VCL. Distribution and licensing[edit] Like Free Pascal, Lazarus is free software. Different portions are distributed under different free software licenses, including GPL, LGPL, MPL, and a modified version of LGPL.[4] Specifically, the LCL, which is statically built into the produced executables, is licensed under a modified version of the LGPL, granting extra permissions to allow it to be statically built into the produced software, including proprietary ones. Note that installing a design-time package is equivalent to linking to the IDE. Thus, distributing the Lazarus IDE with a GPL-incompatible design-time package (e.g. the JEDI packages, which are licensed under the Mozilla Public License) pre-installed would cause a license violation. This does not prohibit proprietary packages from being developed with Lazarus, though. Lazarus is officially distributed via Sourceforge. History[edit] The first attempt to develop a visual IDE for Free Pascal dates back to 1998, when the Megido project commenced. For various reasons this approach failed. Consecutively, some of Megido's developers decided to start a new project based on a more flexible foundation. The first preliminary LCL version could be released in 2001, and in 2003 the first beta version of Lazarus (0.9.0.3) was hosted at SourceForge. The first final Lazarus version (1.0) was released in 2012. Lazarus 1.2 with significant enhancements was released in 2014. The name "Lazarus" alludes to the revival of the Megido vision. It is inspired by Lazarus of Bethany, who, according to the Gospel of John, was restored to life four days after his death by Jesus. Unlike Megido, Lazarus was a big success. It is available for a range of operating systems including various Linux distributions, Mac OS X, BSD, Solaris and Windows. More than four million downloads from SourceForge (as of March 2014) mark the increasing popularity of this IDE.
