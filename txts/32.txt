Server-sent events                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Server-sent events (SSE) is a technology where a browser receives automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection. The Server-Sent Events EventSource API is standardized as part of HTML5[1] by the W3C.    Contents  1 History2 Overview 2.1 Web browsers 3 Libraries4 See also5 References6 External links   History[edit] The WHATWG Web Applications 1.0 proposal[2] included a mechanism to push content to the client. On September 1, 2006, the Opera web browser implemented this new experimental technology in a feature called "Server-Sent Events".[3] Overview[edit] Server-sent events is a standard describing how servers can initiate data transmission towards clients once an initial client connection has been established. They are commonly used to send message updates or continuous data streams to a browser client and designed to enhance native, cross-browser streaming through a JavaScript API called EventSource, through which a client requests a particular URL in order to receive an event stream.
