(November 2007)   Open API (often referred to as OpenAPI new technology) is a term used in the Application Programming Interface (API) process that uses sets of technologies that enable websites to interact with each other by using REST, SOAP, JavaScript and other web technologies. The technology is used in non-web-based applications, and becoming an increasing trend in "Web 2.0" applications. Introduction[edit] The term "Open API" has been recently in use by recent trends in social media and Web 2.0. It is currently a heavily sought after solution to interconnect websites in a more fluid user-friendly manner. Open API also applies to collaborative services environments where managed service providers can also outsource specific services to other providers via systems integration. For example, companies like Level Platforms provide an open API to adapt to any business offering within the managed service environment. With the advent of the Facebook Platform, launched June 1, 2007, Facebook incorporated an open API into its business model. OpenSocial is currently being developed by Google in conjunction with MySpace and other social networks including Bebo.com, Engage.com, Friendster, hi5, Hyves, imeem, LinkedIn, Ning, Oracle, orkut, Plaxo, Salesforce.com, Six Apart, Tianji, Viadeo, VOXOX and XING. The ultimate goal is for any social website to be able to implement the APIs and host third-party social applications. "Open API" is also becoming very popular among technical software, for collaboration between different trades such as architects and engineers. Since there is different software for designing structures, buildings, these trades find a way to use each other's work through "Open API". For example, an architect can draw in CAD software and engineers can implement these plans into their software.
