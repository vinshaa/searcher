(June 2014) mod_proxy is an optional module for the Apache HTTP Server.[1] This module implements a proxy, gateway or cache for Apache. It implements proxying capability for AJP13 (Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3), FTP, CONNECT (for SSL), HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and (since Apache 1.3.23) HTTP/1.1. The module can be configured to connect to other proxy modules for these and other protocols. One powerful feature of Apache is flexible virtual hosting—multiple virtual hosts on a single client. This is a convenient way to partition separate websites and applications. With mod_proxy it is possible to set various web framework based applications up as virtual hosts as well.[2][3][4] mod_proxy can help to improve LAMP security [5] or to strip SSL from HTTP requests.[6]    Contents  1 License2 History3 See also4 Notes5 External links   License[edit] See Apache License. History[edit] This module was experimental in Apache 1.1.x.[7] As of Apache 1.2, mod_proxy stability was greatly improved.[8] Since Apache 2.0, proxy features are divided into several modules in addition to mod_proxy: mod_proxy_http, mod_proxy_ftp, and mod_proxy_connect — moreover, caching is provided by mod_cache and related modules.[9] Since Apache 2.2, mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy_balancer have been added as well.[10] As of Apache 2.4, mod_proxy_fcgi was also added, to proxy FastCGI requests to another server, superseding mod_fcgid and mod_fastcgi.
