Web API                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search            It has been suggested that Web API (content-facing) be merged into this article. (Discuss) Proposed since July 2015. For APIs exposed to web pages, see Web API (content-facing). For the Microsoft ASP.NET Web API, see ASP.NET MVC Framework.

(August 2014) A web API is an application programming interface (API) for either a web server or a web browser.    Contents  1 Server-side2 Client-side3 API modeling languages4 See also5 References6 Further reading   Server-side[edit] A server-side web API is a programmatic interface to a defined request-response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web—most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server. Mashups are web applications which combine the use of multiple such web APIs.[1] Webhooks are server-side web APIs that take as input a URI that is designed to be used like a remote named pipe or a type of callback such that the server acts as a client to dereference the provided URI and trigger an event on another server which handles this event thus providing a type of peer-to-peer IPC. While "web API" in this context is sometimes considered a synonym for web service, Web 2.0 web applications have moved away from SOAP-based web services towards more cohesive collections of RESTful web resources.[2] These RESTful web APIs are accessible via standard HTTP methods by a variety of HTTP clients including browsers and mobile devices. Client-side[edit] A client-side web API is a programmatic interface to extend functionality within a web browser or other HTTP client. Originally these were most commonly in the form of native plug-in architectures however most newer ones target standardized JavaScript bindings. The Mozilla Foundation created their WebAPI specification which is designed to help replace native mobile applications with HTML5 applications.[3][4] Google created their Native Client architecture which is designed to help replace insecure native plug-ins with secure native sandboxed extensions and applications. They have also made this portable by employing a modified LLVM AOT compiler. API modeling languages[edit] A number of modeling languages have been proposed for describing practical web APIs including: RESTful API Modeling LanguageSwaggerAPI Blueprint See also[edit] HTML5 in mobile devices References[edit]  ^ "Mashup Dashboard".
