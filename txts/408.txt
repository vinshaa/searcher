(May 2011)  Northern cavefish Conservation status   Vulnerable (IUCN 2.3) Scientific classificationKingdom:AnimaliaPhylum:ChordataClass:ActinopterygiiOrder:PercopsiformesFamily:AmblyopsidaeGenus:AmblyopsisSpecies:A. spelaeaBinomial nameAmblyopsis spelaea DeKay, 1842  The northern cavefish or northern blindfish, Amblyopsis spelaea, is found in caves through Kentucky and southern Indiana. It is listed as a threatened species in the United States and the IUCN lists the species as vulnerable. During a 2013 study of Amblyopsis spelaea, scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the Ohio River, in Indiana, and one south of the river, in Kentucky. The southern population retained the name A. spelaea and the northern was re-designated Amblyopsis hoosieri in a 2014 paper published in the journal ZooKeys.[1][2] Neither species is found north of the White River, flowing east to west south of Bedford, Indiana.
