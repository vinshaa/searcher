It replaces the Common Public License (CPL) and removes certain terms relating to litigations related to patents.[6] The Eclipse Public License is designed to be a business-friendly free software license and features weaker copyleft provisions than contemporary licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). The receiver of EPL-licensed programs can use, modify, copy and distribute the work and modified versions, in some cases being obligated to release their own changes.[7] The EPL is approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)[3] and is listed as a free software license by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).[2] Discussion of a new version of the EPL began in May, 2013.[8]    Contents  1 Compatibility2 Derivative works3 Later versions4 Comparison with the CPL5 Notable projects 5.1 Licensed solely under the EPL5.2 Multi-licensed under the EPL and one or more other licenses 6 References7 External links   Compatibility[edit] The EPL 1.0 is not compatible with the GPL, and a work created by combining a work licensed under the GPL with a work licensed under the EPL cannot be lawfully distributed. The GPL requires that "[any distributed work] that ... contains or is derived from the [GPL-licensed] Program ... be licensed as a whole ... under the terms of [the GPL]", and that the distributor not "impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted". The EPL, however, requires that anyone distributing the work grant every recipient a license to any patents that they might hold that cover the modifications they have made. Because this is a "further restriction" on the recipients, distribution of such a combined work does not satisfy the GPL.[2] The EPL, in addition, contains a patent retaliation clause, which is incompatible with the GPL for the same reasons.[2] Derivative works[edit] According to article 1(b) of the EPL, additions to the original work may be licensed independently, including under a proprietary license, provided such additions are "separate modules of software" and do not constitute a derivative work.[7][4] Changes and additions which do constitute a derivative work must be licensed under the same terms and conditions of the EPL, which includes the requirement to make source code available.[7] Later versions[edit] If a new version of the EPL is published the user/contributor can choose to distribute the software under the version with which he or she received it or upgrade to the new version.[7] Comparison with the CPL[edit] The EPL was based on the Common Public License (CPL),[9] but there are some differences between the two licenses: The Eclipse Foundation replaces IBM as the Agreement Steward in the EPLThe EPL patent clause is revised by deleting the sentence from section 7 of the CPL[6] A clause contained within the CPL allows for developers to migrate software under the terms of the CPL to the terms of the EPL at any time,[9] similar to how users of the GPL version 2 can migrate to the GPL version 3. Notable projects[edit] In addition to the Eclipse Foundation, the EPL is used in some other projects, especially (but not limited to) those running on the Java virtual machine.
