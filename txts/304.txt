Kerio Connect is an all-in-one messaging and collaboration server, combining email, calendaring and collaboration features with integrated anti-virus, anti-spam, built-in archiving, and automated backup. Kerio Control, a unified threat management solution, delivers protection for networks ranging from simple to complex. Multi-faceted security, including certified firewall, intrusion prevention, VPN services, anti-virus, and web filter, protects the network from a wide array of evolving threats. Kerio has recently entered two new markets with the introduction of Kerio Operator and Samepage.io. Kerio Operator is an IP PBX system tailored for small and medium-sized businesses. Samepage.io is a file sharing and collaboration platform software solution for small and medium businesses that makes sharing and collaborating on documents, text, multimedia content easy.
