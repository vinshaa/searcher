(January 2013) Server-side (commonly referred to as SS) refers to operations that are performed by the server in a client–server relationship in computer networking. Typically, a server is a computer program, such as a web server, that runs on a remote server, reachable from a user's local computer or workstation. Operations may be performed server-side because they require access to information or functionality that is not available on the client, or require typical behavior that is unreliable when it is done client-side. Server-side operations also include processing and storage of data from a client to a server, which can be viewed by a group of clients. Advantage: This lightens the work of your client. This also protects your SAMP server from crackers. Examples of server-side processing include the creation & adaptation of a database using MySQL.
