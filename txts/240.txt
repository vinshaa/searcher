It is used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not articles, or it groups articles by status rather than content. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference 'Show hidden categories' is set.  This category has a backlog that requires the attention of willing editors. This notice will hide itself when this category has fewer than 1000 items. (recount) This category helps keep count of the total number of articles with the {{dead link}} template. They should all be in one of the dated categories. Please review WP:DEADLINK for current policy before editing the tagged dead links. See also Category:Articles with dead external links for a listing organized by month.
