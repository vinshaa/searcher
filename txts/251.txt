Contents  1 Specification-oriented approach2 Components of the XINS technology3 Specifications4 RPC protocol5 Competition6 External links   Specification-oriented approach[edit] The specification-oriented approach is at the heart of XINS: first specifications need to be written;then documentation and code is generated from these specifications;then both testing and implementation can start. From specifications, XINS is able to generate: HTML documentationtest formsSOAP-compliant WSDLa basic Java web applicationunit test code (in Java)stubs (in Java)client-side code (in Java) Components of the XINS technology[edit] Technically, XINS is composed of the following: An XML-based specification format for projects, APIs, functions, types and error codesA POX-style RPC protocol (called the XINS Standard Calling Convention), compatible with web browsers (HTTP parameters in, XML out).A tool for generating human-readable documentation, from the specifications.A tool for generating WSDL, from the specifications.A Log4J-based technology for logging (called Logdoc), offering a specification format, internationalization of log messages, generation of HTML documentation and generation of code.A Java library for calling XINS functions, the XINS/Java Client Framework; in xins-client.jar.A server-side container for Java-based XINS API implementations, the XINS/Java Server Framework; in xins-server.jar. This is like a servlet container for XINS APIs.A Java library with some common functionality, used by both the XINS/Java Client Framework and the XINS/Java Server Framework: the XINS/Java Common Library, in xins-common.jar. An introductory tutorial called the XINS Primer takes the reader by the hand with easy-to-follow steps to perform, with screenshots. Since version 1.3.0, the XINS/Java Server Framework supports not only POX-style calls, but also SOAP and XML-RPC. And it supports conversion using XSLT. As of version 2.0, it also supports JSON and JSON-RPC. XINS is open-source and is distributed under the liberal BSD license. Specifications[edit] All XINS specification files are Plain Old XML. Compared to SOAP/WSDL/UDDI/etc. the format is extremely simple. There are specifications for projects, environment lists, APIs, functions, types and error codes. Below is an example of a XINS project definition.   <project name="MyProject" domain="com.mycompany">   <api name="MyAPI">     <impl/>     <environments/>   </api> </project>  Here is an example of a specification of an environment list:   <environments>   <environment id="netarray" url="http://xins.users.mcs2.netarray.com/myproject/xins/"/> </environments>  An example of an API specification file:   <api name="MyAPI">   <description>My first XINS API</description>   <function name="Hello"/> </api>  An example of a function definition:   <function name="Hello">   <description>Greets the indicated person.</description>   <input>     <param name="name" required="true">       <description>The name of the person to be greeted.</description>     </param>   </input>   <output>     <param name="greeting" required="true">       <description>The constructed greeting.</description>     </param>   </output> </function>  RPC protocol[edit] The XINS Standard Calling Convention is a simple HTTP-based RPC protocol. Input consists of HTTP parameters, while output is an XML document. This approach makes it compatible with plain Web browsers. Example of a request:  http://somehost/someapi/?_convention=_xins-std&_function=SayHello&firstName=John&lastName=Doe  Example of a successful response:   <result>    <param name="greeting">Hello John Doe!</param> </result>  Competition[edit] There are no known products that provide an integrated approach to specification-oriented development, similar to XINS. However, there are several frameworks and libraries that provide functionality similar to individual parts of XINS, including: JWSDP: Collection of various XML and SOAP technologies for the Java programming language.Apache Axis: Java-based framework for SOAP implementations.Codehaus XFire: Idem.Hessian Web Service Protocol: Binary alternative to the XINS Standard Calling Convention.
