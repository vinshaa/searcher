(July 2013)   Web IDL is a format for describing interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web browsers.    Contents  1 Description2 Status of this specification3 Usage4 References5 External links   Description[edit] Web IDL is an IDL variant with:[1] A number of features that allow one to more easily describe the behavior of common script objects in a web context.A mapping of how interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to language constructs within execution environments. The syntax of IDL files is fairly well documented in the Web IDL spec, but it is too formal to read, as Chromium project documentation states.[2] Status of this specification[edit] As of 19 April 2012, Web IDL specification document became Candidate Recommendation of the Web IDL specification. When the document reaches "Recommendation" status, it will have the full powers of W3C standards. Usage[edit] W3C Wiki has a list of W3C Specifications that use Web IDL. [1]Chromium Project has a page about using WebIDL to specify interfaces in Blink (layout engine) [3]Mozilla uses Web IDL in their software creation process, mapping implementations to Web IDL specs.[4]When WebKit is built, the IDL files are parsed, creates the code to bind interfaces to implementations [5] References[edit]  ^ "Web Interface Definition Language".
