mod_python                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          mod_python is an Apache HTTP Server module that integrates the Python programming language with the server. It is intended to provide a Python language binding for the Apache HTTP Server. mod_python is more efficient for Python scripts than using CGI as CGI requests require starting a new Python process to respond to each individual web request.[1]    Contents  1 History2 See also3 References4 External links   History[edit] The initial implementation of mod_python was a port to Apache HTTP server of a project called NSAPy. NSAPy was written by Aaron Watters for the Netscape Enterprise Server and was used as an example in a chapter of the book "Internet Programming with Python" written by Aaron Watters, Guido van Rossum, and James Ahlstrom.[2] The first version of mod_python was released by Gregory Trubetskoy in 2000. In September 2002, mod_python was donated to the Apache Software Foundation and became part of the Apache HTTP Server project. Development on the project eventually ceased due to inactivity of the primary contributors and in The Apache Software Foundation June 16, 2010 Board meeting, the Board unanimously passed a resolution terminating Apache Quetzalcoatl Project (umbrella project for mod_python).[3] In September 2013, development of mod_python resumed, this time independent of the Apache Software Foundation.[4] See also[edit]  Free software portal  Apache HTTP ServerPython References[edit]  ^ http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/10/02/mod_python.html^ http://modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/intr-history.html^ http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2010/board_minutes_2010_06_16.txt^ http://grisha.org/blog/2013/08/02/hacking-on-mod-python-again/  External links[edit] Official websiteNSAPy    vte  Web interfaces Server-side   Protocols   CGISCGIFCGIAJPWSRPWebSocket   Server APIs   C NSAPIC ASAPIC ISAPICOM ASPJava servlet container Portlet container CIL System.Web.IHttpHandlerPython WSGIRuby RackJavaScript JSGIPerl PSGILua WSAPIOWIN   Apache modules   mod_jkmod_lispmod_monomod_parrotmod_perlmod_phpmod_proxymod_pythonmod_wsgimod_rubyPhusion Passenger   Topics   Web resource vs. Web serviceOpen APIWebhookApplication server comparison    Client-side   Browser APIs   C NPAPI LiveConnectXPConnect C NPRuntimeC PPAPI NaCl ActiveX   Web APIs    W3C   AudioCanvasCORSFileGeolocationIndexedDBMicrodataSSESVGVideoWebRTCWebSocketWeb messagingWeb storageWeb workerXMLHttpRequest   Khronos   WebCLWebGL   Others   GearsWeb SQL Database (formerly W3C)    Topics   MashupWeb IDL                        Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mod_python&oldid=671383955"          Categories: Apache httpd modulesPython (programming language)Hidden categories: Articles with underscores in the title                      Navigation menu                      Personal tools       Create accountLog in                                  Namespaces       ArticleTalk                                      Variants                                                                     Views       ReadEditView history                        More                                                       Search                                                                                     Navigation               Main pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaWikipedia store                   Interaction               HelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact page                   Tools               What links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationWikidata itemCite this page                   Print/export               Create a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version                   Languages               Deutsch????????????????????
