In the latter versions of ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) will merge into a unified MVC 6.[3] The project is called "ASP.NET vNext".

The MVC model defines web applications with 3 logic layers: Model (business layer)View (display layer)Controller (input control) A model represents the state of a particular aspect of the application. A controller handles interactions and updates the model to reflect a change in state of the application, and then passes information to the view. A view accepts necessary information from the controller and renders a user interface to display that information.[4] In April 2009, the ASP.NET MVC source code was released under the Microsoft Public License (MS-PL).[5] ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that is integrated with existing ASP.NET features. Some of these integrated features are master pages and membership-based authentication. The MVC framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly.[6] The ASP.NET MVC Framework couples the models, views, and controllers using interface-based contracts, thereby allowing each component to be tested independently. Apache License 2.0 release[edit] In March 2012, Scott Guthrie announced on his blog that Microsoft had released part of their web stack (including ASP.NET MVC, Razor and Web API) under an open source license (Apache License 2.0).[7] Guthrie wrote that "Doing so will enable a more open development model where everyone in the community will be able to engage and provide feedback on code checkins, bug-fixes, new feature development, and build and test the products on a daily basis using the most up-to-date version of the source code and tests." The source code now resides on CodePlex. ASP.NET Web Forms was not included in this initiative for various reasons.[8] Release history[edit] Release historyDateVersion10 December 2007ASP.NET MVC CTP13 March 2009ASP.NET MVC 1.0[9]16 December 2009ASP.NET MVC 2 RC[10]4 February 2010ASP.NET MVC 2 RC 2[11]10 March 2010ASP.NET MVC 2[12]6 October 2010ASP.NET MVC 3 Beta[13]9 November 2010ASP.NET MVC 3 RC[13]10 December 2010ASP.NET MVC 3 RC 2[14]13 January 2011ASP.NET MVC 3[15]20 September 2011ASP.NET MVC 4 Developer Preview[16]15 February 2012ASP.NET MVC 4 Beta[17]31 May 2012ASP.NET MVC 4 RC[18]15 August 2012ASP.NET MVC 4[19]30 May 2013ASP.NET MVC 4 4.0.30506.0 [20]26 June 2013ASP.NET MVC 5 Preview [21]23 August 2013ASP.NET MVC 5 RC 1[22]17 October 2013ASP.NET MVC 5[22]17 January 2014ASP.NET MVC 5.1[22]10 February 2014ASP.NET MVC 5.1.1[22]4 April 2014ASP.NET MVC 5.1.2[22]22 June 2014ASP.NET MVC 5.1.3[22]1 July 2014ASP.NET MVC 5.2.0[22]28 August 2014ASP.NET MVC 5.2.2[22]9 January 2015ASP.NET MVC 5.2.3[22] View engines[edit] The view engines used in the ASP.NET MVC 3 and MVC 4 Frameworks are the Razor View Engine and the Web Forms view engine. Both view engines are part of the MVC 3 framework. By default, the view engine in the MVC framework uses Razor .cshtml and .vbhtml, or Web Forms .aspx pages to design the layout of the user interface pages onto which the data is composed. However, different view engines can be used.[23] Additionally, rather than the default ASP.NET Web Forms postback model, any interactions are routed to the controllers using the ASP.NET Routing mechanism. Views can be mapped to REST-friendly URLs.[4] Other view engines: The MVCContrib library contains 8 alternate view engines. Brail, NDjango, NHaml, NVelocity, SharpTiles, Spark, StringTemplate and XSLT.The StringTemplate View Engine utilizes a .NET port of the popular Java Templating engine, StringTemplate.Spark is a view engine for the ASP.NET MVC (and the Castle Project MonoRail) frameworks.NDjango is a port of the popular Django templating engine to .NET. It is written in F# and comes with Visual Studio extension including full Intellisense supportNaked Objects MVC - an implementation of the naked objects pattern using ASP.NET MVCRazor is a view-engine developed by Microsoft and released with MVC 3 that is optimized around HTML generation using a code-focused templating approach.
