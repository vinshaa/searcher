It runs natively on Unix-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows.[7] Application support[edit] lighttpd supports the FastCGI, SCGI and CGI interfaces to external programs, allowing web applications written in any programming language to be used with the server. As a particularly popular language, PHP performance has received special attention. Lighttpd's FastCGI can be configured to support PHP with opcode caches (like APC) properly and efficiently. Additionally, it has received attention from its popularity within the Python, Perl, Ruby and Lua communities. Lighttpd also supports WebDNA, the resilient in-memory database system designed to build database-driven websites. It is a popular web server for the Catalyst and Ruby on Rails web frameworks. Lighttpd does not support ISAPI. Features[edit] Load balancing FastCGI, SCGI and HTTP proxy supportchroot supportweb server event mechanism performance – select(), poll(), and epoll() [8]Support for more efficient event notification schemes like kqueue and epollConditional rewrites (mod rewrite)TLS/SSL with SNI support, via OpenSSL.Authentication against an LDAP serverRRDtool statisticsRule-based downloading with possibility of a script handling only authenticationServer Side Includes support (but not server-side CGI)[9]Flexible virtual hostingModules supportCache Meta Language (currently being replaced by mod_magnet)[10] using the Lua programming languageMinimal WebDAV supportServlet (AJP) support (in versions 1.5.x and up)HTTP compression using mod_compress and the newer mod_deflate (1.5.x)Light-weight (less than 1 MB)[11]Single-process design with only several threads. No processes or threads started per connection. Limitations[edit] Lighttpd (1.4.x) officially does not support sending large files from CGI, FastCGI, or proxies [12] unless X-Sendfile is used. Usage[edit]     The LAMP software bundle (here additionally with Squid). A high performance and high-availability solution for a hostile environment   Lighttpd is used by a number of high-traffic websites, among them are Bloglines and Xkcd.[13] It was used in the past by Meebo and YouTube.[14][better source needed] Wikimedia also runs Lighttpd servers.[15][16][17][18] See also[edit]  Free software portal  Comparison of web server softwareInternet Cache ProtocolProxy server which discusses client-side proxiesReverse proxy which discusses origin-side proxiesTraffic ServerWeb accelerator which discusses host-based HTTP acceleration References[edit]  ^ "1.4.36". 2015-07-26.

The typical scenario is using lighttpd as off-load server to push out static content and leave the complex work to another server.   Bibliography[edit]  Bogus, Andre (October 29, 2008).
