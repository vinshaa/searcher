The last major release was Dolphin Smalltalk X6, which comes in two versions: Community Edition (free)Professional edition (commercial) currently in version 6.02 Dolphin is notable for its integrated development environment. The toolset of this Smalltalk dialect include an integrated refactoring browser, a package browser and a WYSIWYG "view composer". Dolphin Smalltalk deviates from the convention of the Smalltalk MVC framework with a model-presenter-view framework. The free community version may be one of the richest free programming environments for the Windows operating system because of the nature of the tutorials and sample applications and the rich class libraries. Other Smalltalk dialects for Windows include Smalltalk MT and the Smalltalk dialects from Cincom.
