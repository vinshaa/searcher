Orion Application Server                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Orion Application Server is a Java EE application server developed by Swedish company IronFlare AB, founded by Magnus Stenman and Karl Avedal. First released in 1999,[1] Orion claims to be the first commercially available application server with full Java EE support.[2] The current stable version is 2.0.7 which is compliant with Java EE version 1.3. Oracle Corporation acquired license to the source of Orion in 2001, and developed it as Oracle Application Server Containers for Java EE (OC4J). OC4J and some of its documentation contains reference to the Orion server.[3] Orion developers were involved in maintenance and enhancements of the source for Oracle.[4][5] IronFlare became an official Java EE licensee[6] in 2003,[1] which enabled them to access the Sun Microsystems compatibility testing tools to ensure correct implementation of the Java EE specification by Orion. Orion is the only product of IronFlare, hence Orion has been marketed more than the company itself.[7] Version history[edit] 1.5.4, February 20021.6.0, July 20022.0, March 2003[4]2.0.1, April 20032.0.2, June 20032.0.3, May 20042.0.4, November 20042.0.5, November 20042.0.6, February 20052.0.7, March 2006 (stable release)[8]2.0.8 (experimental build) References[edit]  ^ a b http://www.orionserver.com/news/j2ee-licensing.html^ http://www.orionserver.com/faq/category.jsp?id=4#12^ http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B31017_01/web.1013/b28952/overview.htm^ a b http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=18413^ http://web.archive.org/web/20071214053834/http://my.opera.com/behrangsa/blog/is-orion-application-server-dead^ http://java.sun.com/j2ee/licensees/ironFlare.html^ http://www.orionserver.com/faq/category.jsp?id=4#3^ http://forums.orionserver.com/viewlist.jsp?name=orion-announce-interest&id=1691  http://forums.orionserver.com/viewlist.jsp?name=orion-announce-interest&first=484http://forums.orionserver.com External links[edit] Oracle licences Orion Server                    Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orion_Application_Server&oldid=611171217"          Categories: Java enterprise platformWeb server softwareOracle software                      Navigation menu                      Personal tools       Create accountLog in                                  Namespaces       ArticleTalk                                      Variants                                                                     Views       ReadEditView history                        More                                                       Search                                                                                     Navigation               Main pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaWikipedia store                   Interaction               HelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact page                   Tools               What links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationWikidata itemCite this page                   Print/export               Create a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version                   Languages               DeutschMagyar     Edit links                          This page was last modified on 2 June 2014, at 02:20.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.
