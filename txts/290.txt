It is a lightweight,[4] high-performance[5] web server/reverse proxy licensed under the GNU General Public License. Its goal is to be fast and fully functional yet still light. Major features of Cherokee include a graphical administration interface named cherokee-admin, and a modular light-weight design. Independent tests have shown Cherokee to be better performing than Apache[6][7] when serving up both static and dynamic content. Cherokee is maintained and developed by an open source community.[8]    Contents  1 Features 1.1 Web server features1.2 Web applications [15] 2 See also3 References4 External links   Features[edit] Web server features[edit] TLS and SSL [9]Virtual servers [10]URL rewriting and redirections supporting regular expressionsAuthentication via htdigest, htpasswd, LDAP, MySQL, PAM, plain, and fixed list.[11]Reverse HTTP proxyHTTP load balancingTraffic shapingCustom and Apache compatible log format.[12]Ability to launch web applications on demandAudio/video streamingOn the fly gzip and deflate compressionsResilient to the 10000 simultaneous connections barrierServer Side Includes (SSI)CGIFastCGISCGIuWSGI support [13]chroot supportRRDtool statisticsDatabase bridging and sharding (DBSlayer-like)Graphical configuration interfacePoint & click deployments through an application market [14] Web applications [15][edit] Configuration wizards are provided to automatically configure the web server to perform specific tasks, or run frameworks and applications.
