Web Container vs. Servlet Container[edit] Isn't the correct title for this article "Servlet Container". At least Tomcat speaks of being a servlet container... —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 193.170.161.222 (talk) 10:42, 10 May 2007 (UTC).  Tomcat is just one of many. It may have started off as a Servlet Container, -which I do not even know for sure-, but nowadays, there are more than just this one Web-technology abusing the HTTP-protocol. My personal choice would be Web-Dumpster, but feel free to variate on the motive.--84.56.67.43 (talk) 12:42, 22 October 2008 (UTC)  List of Servlet containers[edit] The List of Servlet containers is a long list, all under either commercial or non-commercial "web container" headings. I recognized some like Jetty (web server) that I have seen referred to as web containers elsewhere. So should Web container include all of these? --JWB (talk) 00:57, 19 April 2009 (UTC) This page makes the distinction between commercial and non-commercial servlet containers. Would a better distinction be whether the container is open source or not? —Preceding unsigned comment added by 80.167.223.65 (talk) 07:39, 14 March 2010 (UTC) Also, that particular distinction is not strictly enforced. Or is JBoss somehow both commercial and non-commercial?! -- Jokes Free4Me (talk) 10:09, 6 February 2014 (UTC)                    Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Web_container&oldid=668925659"          Categories: Stub-Class Java articlesLow-importance Java articlesAutomatically assessed Java articlesWikiProject Java articlesStub-Class Computing articlesUnknown-importance Computing articlesStub-Class Computer networking articlesUnknown-importance Computer networking articlesAll Computer networking articlesStub-Class Computer networking articles of Unknown-importanceAutomatically assessed Computing articlesAll Computing articles                      Navigation menu                      Personal tools       Create accountLog in                                  Namespaces       ArticleTalk                                      Variants                                                                     Views       ReadEditNew sectionView history                        More                                                       Search                                                                                     Navigation               Main pageContentsFeatured contentCurrent eventsRandom articleDonate to WikipediaWikipedia store                   Interaction               HelpAbout WikipediaCommunity portalRecent changesContact page                   Tools               What links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage information                   Print/export               Create a bookDownload as PDFPrintable version                   Languages                                              This page was last modified on 27 June 2015, at 16:58.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.
