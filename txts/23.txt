WildFly is written in Java, and implements the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification. It runs on multiple platforms. WildFly is free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1. The renaming to WildFly was done to reduce confusion. The renaming only affects the JBoss Application Server project. The JBoss Community and the Red Hat JBoss product line (with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform) retain their names.[4]    Contents  1 Origin2 Versions3 Product features4 Licensing and pricing5 See also6 Notes7 References8 External links   Origin[edit] In 1999, Marc Fleury started a free software project named EJB-OSS (stands for Enterprise Java Bean Open Source Software) implementing the EJB API from J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition). Sun Microsystems asked the project to stop using the EJB trademark within its name. EJB-OSS was then renamed to JBOSS, then JBoss later.[5] .

It requires the Java Development Kit version 5, and includes Tomcat 5.5.5.15.023 May 2009A minor update of the major release JBoss AS 5.0, which was in development for at least three years and was built on top of a new JBoss microcontainer.[6] JBoss AS 5.1 contains a preview of some elements from the Java EE 6 specification.[7]6.0[8]6.028 December 2010Although JBoss AS 6 does support the full Java EE 6 stack,[9] Red Hat elected not to certify it with Oracle[10][11] It is, however, officially certified to support the Java EE 6 Web Profile.7.0[12] "Lightning"6.012 July 2011The Java EE profile is only partially implemented: It includes MDBs, but listening to JMS destinations is not supported.[13] It is, however, certified for the Web Profile. The software code has been completely rewritten for JBoss AS 7.[14][15] Major changes visible to the user are the inability to define resources like JMS destinations and datasources inside archives (war/ear),[16][17] the way datasources are defined,[18][19] a much smaller size (less than half of JBoss AS 6)[12] and a 10-fold reduction in startup time.[20]7.16.016 February 2012Red Hat implemented the remaining parts of the EE spec, and this version was certified for the EE full profile.[21]8.0.07.020 November 2014[22]JBoss renamed to WildFly.

Before November 2010 JBoss was licensed as annual subscription in bundles of 4 and 32 CPU sockets. As of November 2010 the licensing changed and all cores on the system are now counted. The core bundles licensing is available for 16 and 64 cores.[23] See also[edit]  Free Software portal  Comparison of application serversJBoss Enterprise Application PlatformList of JBoss softwareApache TomEEApache GeronimoIBM WebSphere Application ServerJOnAS application serverOracle WebLogic ServerGlassFish Notes[edit]  ^ "WildFly 9.0.1.Final and 8.2.1.Final are released.". ^ "WildFly 10.0.0.Beta2 git tag on GitHub". ^ "JBoss Application Server has a new name...
