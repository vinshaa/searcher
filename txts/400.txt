The source code (~50KB) is written almost entirely in PHP and engineered specifically with user experience and usability as its primary design goals.[2][3][4] Commonly called F3 by PHP developers, Fat-Free was released as free software in 2009.[5] Its general architecture was influenced by Ruby's Sinatra. The lightweight code base[6] is controlled and actively maintained by a small core team, with additional functionality and funding contributions coming from various enterprises and user groups,[7] who also help guide its future direction. The base feature set includes a URL router, cache engine, and support for multilingual applications. Fat-Free also has a number of plug-ins that extend its functionality as well as data mappers for SQL and NoSQL database back-ends: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Sybase, DB2, MongoDB, CouchDB, and Flat File.
