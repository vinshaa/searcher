I tried to do something similar earlier and was attacked quite viciously but somehow you managed it without all the screaming, and having looked there a few times since I think it has really helped the atmosphere. Dmcq (talk) 09:42, 27 April 2013 (UTC) Teahouse BarnstarThanks for your contributions to the Teahouse project - your thoughts, code, and help giving more new editors access to the space are all deeply appreciated.

Hereby I, Beagel, award you this Environmental Barnstar for your calm and balanced actions on this overheated topic. I hope you will still find a time to help improving the Hydraulic fracturing and its related articles. Thank you.

Thank You. Bgwhite (talk) 20:56, 12 May 2012 (UTC) The Technical BarnstarI wanted to formally thank you for creating the CatListMainTalkLinks script I requested.

For being cool about it, working with me, and showing humility after the fact, I force upon you, the deserving, this barnstar.   Nezzadar ?   18:46, 18 October 2009 (UTC) The Barnstar of PeaceFor your sober and fair conduct throughout the Virgin Killer image discussion and despite (or perhaps because of) our initial disagreement. Most impressed Acer (talk) 22:45, 9 May 2008 (UTC) The Random Acts of Kindness BarnstarI didn't get to give you this barnstar earlier but here it is. Thanks for the above.
