A '''Web service''' is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a [[computer network|network]]. It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service ''always on'' as in the concept of [[utility computing]]. The [[W3C]] defines a Web service generally as: {{bq| a software system designed to support [[interoperability|interoperable]] machine-to-machine interaction over a [[computer network|network]].<ref name=W3WSG>{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-ws-gloss-20040211/#webservice | title = Web Services Glossary | date = 2004-02-11 | publisher = [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] | accessdate = 2011-04-22}}</ref>}}  The [http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/arch/ W3C Web Services Architecture Working Group] defined a Web Services Architecture, requiring a specific implementation of a "Web service." In this: {{bq| [a Web service] has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using [[SOAP]] (Simple Object Access Protocol) messages, typically conveyed using [[HTTP]] with an [[XML]] [[serialization]] in conjunction with other Web-related standards.<ref name=W3WSG />}}  The W3C also states: {{bq|We can identify two major classes of Web services: *{{em|[[representational state transfer|REST]]-compliant Web services}}, in which the primary purpose of the service is to manipulate representations of [[Web resource]]s using a uniform set of [[Stateless protocol|stateless]] operations. *{{em|Arbitrary Web services}}, in which the service may expose an arbitrary set of operations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-ws-arch-20040211/#relwwwrest | title = Relationship to the World Wide Web and REST Architectures | work= Web Services Architecture| publisher =  [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] | accessdate = 2011-04-22}}</ref>}} == Explanation == The term "Web services" describes a standardized way of integrating Web-based applications using the XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI open standards over an Internet protocol backbone. XML is used to tag the data, SOAP is used to transfer the data, WSDL is used for describing the services available and UDDI lists what services are available.  A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network. It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service always on as in the concept of utility computing. The W3C defines a Web service generally as:           a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network.{{cn|date=August 2015}}  Many organizations use multiple software systems for management.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Different software systems often need to exchange data with each other, and a Web service is a method of communication that allows two software systems to exchange this data over the internet. The software system that requests data is called a ''service requester'', whereas the software system that would process the request and provide the data is called a ''[[service provider]]''.  Different software may use different programming languages, and hence there is a need for a method of data exchange that doesn't depend upon a particular programming language. Most types of software can, however, interpret XML tags. Thus, Web services can use XML files for data exchange.  Rules for communication between different systems need to be defined, such as: * How one system can request data from another system. * Which specific parameters are needed in the data request * What would be the structure of the data produced. (Normally, data is exchanged in XML files, and the structure of the XML file is validated against an .xsd file.) * What error messages to display when a certain rule for communication is not observed, to make [[troubleshooting]] easier  All of these rules for communication are defined in a file called [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] (Web Services Description Language), which has a <code>.wsdl</code> extension. (Proposals for '''Autonomous Web Services''' ('''AWS''') seek to develop more flexible web services which do not rely on strict rules.<ref> Compare: {{cite book | last1                 = Oya | first1                = Makoto | chapter               = Autonomous Web Services Based on Dynamic Model Harmonization | editor1-last          = Oya | editor1-first         = Makoto | editor2-last          = Uda | editor2-first         = Ryuya | editor3-last          = Yasunobu | editor3-first         = Chizuko | title                 = Towards Sustainable Society on Ubiquitous Networks: The 8th IFIP Conference on E-Business, E-Services, and E-Society (I3E 2008), September 24 - 26, 2008, Tokyo, Japan | url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=__WWduWBk7IC | series                = IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology | volume                = 286 | publisher             = Springer Science & Business Media | publication-date      = 2008 | page                  = 139 | isbn                  = 9780387856902 | accessdate            = 2015-08-19 | quote                 = Under the current Web Services, [...] stakeholder systems must follow the predefined rules for a particular business service including those about business protocols to send/receive messages and about system operation.

The service requester contacts UDDI to find out who is the provider for the data it needs, and then it contacts the service provider using the SOAP protocol. The service provider validates the service request and sends structured data in an XML file, using the SOAP protocol. This XML file would be validated again by the service requester using an XSD file. | 241x241px]]  A directory called [[Universal Description Discovery and Integration|UDDI]] (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) defines which software system should be contacted for which type of data. So when one software system needs one particular report/data, it would go to the UDDI and find out which other system it can contact for receiving that data. Once the software system finds out which other system it should contact, it would then contact that system using a special protocol called [[SOAP]] (Simple Object Access Protocol). The service provider system would first validate the data request by referring to the WSDL file, and then process the request and send the data under the SOAP protocol.  ==Web API== [[File:SOA Detailed Diagram.png|thumb|right|Web services in a [[service-oriented architecture]].|325x325px]] A [[Web API]] is a development in Web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler [[representational state transfer]] (REST) based communications.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1109/MIC.2008.110}}</ref> RESTful APIs do not require XML-based Web service protocols (SOAP and WSDL) to support their interfaces.  ==Automated design methods{{anchor|Design methods}}== Automated tools can aid in the creation of a Web service. For services using WSDL, it is possible to either automatically generate WSDL for existing classes (a bottom-up model) or to generate a class skeleton given existing WSDL (a top-down model). * A developer using a bottom-up model writes implementing classes first (in some programming language), and then uses a WSDL generating tool to expose methods from these classes as a Web service. This is simpler to develop but may be harder to maintain if the original classes are subject to frequent change.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jst.ws.doc.user/concepts/cwsbtmup.html | title = Help - Creating bottom-up Web services | publisher = [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-04-22}}</ref> * A developer using a top-down model writes the WSDL document first and then uses a code generating tool to produce the class skeleton, to be completed as necessary. This model is generally considered more difficult but can produce cleaner designs and is generally more resistant to change. As long as the message formats between sender and receiver do not change, changes in the sender and receiver themselves do not affect the Web service. The technique is also referred to as ''contract first'' since the WSDL (or contract between sender and receiver) is the starting point.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jst.ws.doc.user/concepts/cwstopdown.html | title = Help - Creating top-down Web services | publisher = [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] | accessdate = 2011-04-22}}</ref> *  A developer using a Subset WSDL (SWSDL)<ref name=SWSDL>{{cite doi|10.1109/CloudCom.2014.149}}</ref> (i.e. a WSDL with the subset operation in the original WSDL) can perform web service testing and top down development.  ==Web services that use markup languages== There are a number of Web services that use markup languages: * [[JSON-RPC]] * [[JSON-WSP]] * [[Web template]] * [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) '''from''' the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] * [[XML Interface for Network Services]] (XINS) provides a [[Plain Old XML|POX]]-style Web service specification format * [[Web Services Conversation Language]] (WSCL) * [[Web Services Flow Language]] (WSFL) (superseded by [[Business Process Execution Language|BPEL]]) * [[WS-MetadataExchange]] * [[Representational state transfer]] (REST) versus [[remote procedure call]] (RPC) * [[XML-RPC]] - XML - Remote Procedure Call  ==Criticisms== Critics of non-RESTful Web services often complain that they are too complex<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/21/WS-Research | title = WS-Pagecount | last = Bray|first= Tim | authorlink = Tim Bray | publisher = TBray.org | date = 2004-10-28 | accessdate = 2011-04-22}}</ref> and based upon large software vendors or integrators, rather than typical [[open source]] implementations.  There are also concerns about performance due to Web services' use of XML as a message format and SOAP/HTTP in enveloping and transporting.<ref>{{cite web | first = N. A.

[[Regression testing]] is performed by identifying the changes made thereafter. Web service regression testing needs can be categorized in three different ways, namely, changes in WSDL, changes in code, and selective re-testing of Web service operations. We can capture the above three needs in three intermediate forms of Subset WSDL,<ref name=SWSDL /> namely, Difference WSDL (DWSDL), Unit WSDL (UWSDL), and Reduced WSDL (RWSDL), respectively. These three Subset WSDLs are then combined to form Combined WSDL (CWSDL) that is further used for regression testing of the Web service. This will help in Automated Web Service Change Management,<ref name=AWSCM /> by performing the selection of the relevant test cases to construct a reduced test suite from the old test suite. <ref>{{cite doi|10.1109/MESOCA.2013.6632734}}</ref>  ==Web Service Change Management== Work related to the dealing with the visualization and capturing changes in a Web service. Visualization and computation of changes can be done in the form of intermediate artifacts (Subset WSDL).<ref name=SWSDL /> The insight on computation of change impact is helpful in testing, top down development and reduce regression testing. Automated Web Service Change Management (AWSCM)<ref name=AWSCM>{{cite doi|10.1109/CloudCom.2014.144}}</ref> is a tool that identify subset operations in a WSDL file to construct a Subset WSDL.  ==See also== * [[List of web service frameworks]] * [[List of Web service protocols]] * [[List of Web service specifications]] * [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA)  ==References== {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Commons category|Web services}} {{Wikiversity}} * [https://java.net/downloads/jt/MDP.pdf Messaging Design Pattern and a distributed component/service model] * [http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/ W3C Web Services Activity home page ] * [http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch/ Web Services Architecture] (W3C Working Group Note) * [http://www2008.org/papers/fp389.html Where to find Web Services on the Web: Investigating Web Services on the World Wide Web (2008)] * [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-95/SP800-95.pdf NIST SP800-95 Guide to Secure Web Services] <!-- ==============================({{NoMoreLinks}})============================== --> <!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
