I don't have an opinion about the move. PeterSymonds (talk) 07:40, 31 August 2010 (UTC) FYI[edit] An SPI where you previously commented has been reopened. See Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Nableezy. Sincerely, --brewcrewer (yada, yada) 02:40, 2 September 2010 (UTC) Onelifefreak2007[edit] Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Onelifefreak2007/Archive I would appreciate it, if you could take another look at this. Compare Razzinator (talk · contribs) with Razzfan (talk · contribs). Similar usernames, and both make unsourced changes to "Razzie" Awards pages. Thank you for your time, -- Cirt (talk) 14:50, 2 September 2010 (UTC) Sorry, there just isn't enough behavioural evidence for me to take any action here. I don't think this is a sock issue. The fact that similar usernames edit an article with a similar name and introduce unsourced edits over a year apart is not strong enough. I think this now needs to be addressed as a content issue; if the edits are problematic, feel free to bring them up on the applicable noticeboard. With a few fairly obvious differences in behaviour, I don't feel comfortable with labelling this user as a sockpuppet. PeterSymonds (talk) 15:20, 2 September 2010 (UTC) Coincidentally, User talk:Razzfan has been blocked repeatedly for that same behavior pattern. So you are correct, in that if it keeps up, the account will likely face escalating blocks. -- Cirt (talk) 15:23, 2 September 2010 (UTC) I'm fine if he's blocked; I'm not defending his behaviour, and I haven't particularly studied it. What I have studied are his behavioural patterns from a sockpuppet investigation point of view. I would just rather not see him blocked as a sockpuppet without sufficient evidence and, while convincing, there just isn't enough in my view. Another clerk may disagree before the case is archived. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 15:26, 2 September 2010 (UTC) The case has already been archived. No worries, -- Cirt (talk) 15:27, 2 September 2010 (UTC)    Can you take a look at this? Same exact articles, similar usernames, same pattern of adding unsourced info, articles include List of Total Drama series characters and List of General Hospital cast members and Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress, etc. This is not simply coincidence. How can I appeal this sock investigation finding? Can you please have another look at the contribs of Razzinator (talk · contribs) with Razzfan (talk · contribs) ? -- Cirt (talk) 15:38, 2 September 2010 (UTC) Update - more evidence connecting Razzinator to Razzfan Compare [1] with [2]. Thank you for your time, -- Cirt (talk) 15:49, 2 September 2010 (UTC) PeterSymonds, have you had a chance to compare these two diffs? This really is a case of WP:DUCK. Thank you for your time, -- Cirt (talk) 03:36, 21 September 2010 (UTC) PeterSymonds, I see you were able to address me, here [3]. Perhaps you can please respond to my query, in this thread on your user talk page? Thank you for your time, -- Cirt (talk) 18:42, 4 October 2010 (UTC) Sorry, I thought it was a little redundant considering Fastily blocked him for unrelated reasons on September 8, so I considered the matter resolved. Was there something else you needed me to look at? Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:45, 4 October 2010 (UTC) I had not realized that. A response to my repeated queries to your talk page would have been nice. I was starting to get under the impression that you were ignoring me. :( -- Cirt (talk) 18:47, 4 October 2010 (UTC) Nah, I'd actually missed the thread responses until fairly recently, so I wasn't sure whether you were still wanting a follow-up. Sorry about that. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:48, 4 October 2010 (UTC) Oh. Alright. Well - I had posted three followup requests in the interim... Oh well. Thank you for the response today. :) Cheers, -- Cirt (talk) 18:52, 4 October 2010 (UTC)      Nableezy SPI[edit] I believe you closed the case prematurely. The new accusations are behaviorally based, not technically based, and the previous findings do not shed light on the behavior. I agree that a new CU check will not be helpful, but an experienced admin should review the behavioral suggestions and comment on their strength or weakness. Therefore, I reopened the case and put it into the non-CU section. Thank you. -- Avi (talk) 19:13, 2 September 2010 (UTC) With respect, I'm well aware that checkuser is not the only form of evidence, and while my comment may not have been clear enough, I'm still not convinced that the behavioural evidence is adequate to suggest sockpuppetry. It was comprehensive but circumstantial at best. I read through everything before making my closing comment, and I'll read through it again, but I was not convinced. PeterSymonds (talk) 19:18, 2 September 2010 (UTC) Fair enough, if you read it through and decide that the behavioral evidence is insufficient, please note that. Thanks! -- Avi (talk) 19:24, 2 September 2010 (UTC)  Thank you for your help![edit] Thank you for your help, I talked with you on #wikipedia-en-help as Loki, and you helped me in marking my CI as edit=sysop as requested (Protection Log). Again, thank you for your help. --»Wolfnix« 23:21, 4 September 2010 (UTC) You're welcome. PeterSymonds (talk) 23:22, 4 September 2010 (UTC) SPI clerking[edit] Hello, I am interested in becoming a clerk at SPI. You were on the list of clerks and didn't have a trainee so I decided to contact you. I have Rollback and am familiar with the allowed uses of alt. accounts and am a fairly well established/ trusted editor. I know I'm knew but that doesn't mean that I don't understand the policies. I understand them and follow them. Mr. R00t Talk 19:28, 5 September 2010 (UTC) Hi; thanks for your interest. At the moment our backlog is almost exclusively centred around the administration of cases (primarily blocking users). We have enough clerks to deal with the other bits, but we'll let you know if we need more. Thanks again. PeterSymonds (talk) 19:31, 5 September 2010 (UTC) Wouldn't it make sense for you to be training new clerks for when you have a backlog of new cases? Mr. R00t Talk 19:49, 5 September 2010 (UTC) Yeah, but we're really in need of more people who can take care of them by blocking users and making admin judgements based on things like deleted content and contributions. DeltaQuad and Spitfire (among others) adequately cover the non-admin side of things, but we're only after admins to train at the moment. Sorry. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 19:52, 5 September 2010 (UTC) Alright, please contact me when you need clerks again. Mr. R00t Talk 19:57, 5 September 2010 (UTC)    Fabstoflops sockpuppetry block[edit] I'm missing what in the contributions points to User:Fabstoflops being a sock of anyone listed here. What in their contributions points to this?--Chaser (talk) 03:20, 6 September 2010 (UTC) Hi. The page Pete Burgess after tagging it for deletion for being created by a blocked user. The other socks of Googler459 started reverting vandalism in a similar way (using the same manual summaries for warning. It's also interesting, although probably not very relevant, that this user falsifies rollback and Igloo summaries when reverting edits. It was mainly a block based on the page and similar reversions; the user denying knowledge of Bonkers189 seems odd considering the page he tagged as being created by a "blocked user" was clearly tagged as Bonkers189. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 06:10, 6 September 2010 (UTC) Gay Nigger Association of America up for Deletion Review[edit] Hello! Since you participated in The MfD, you might be interested in participating in the Deletion Review, as well. LiteralKa (talk) 04:22, 6 September 2010 (UTC) A question[edit] 1st question: Hello, I have a question regarding talk pages. On English wiki we should use English language when we talk? Right? The use of other languages is not allowed? 2nd: About the warning I received[4] on the false request of User:Nmate, it is important to be retracted[5] because if another "report"[6] (where the result was case not valid) like this appear I could be banned for no apparent reason. Since the Admin who issued this warning is on indefinite Wikibreak I would like to ask you for the possibility of retracting this warning. Thank you. Adrian (talk) 12:50, 7 September 2010 (UTC) "Palestinian leaders are habitual liars" Wikifan12345 is messing up the Hamas page.[edit] "Palestinian leaders are habitual liars" is one of his comments from the talk page, where you can get an excellent impression of him. Anyway, I will be patient, but thought you should know he seems on a sometimes incoherent campaign to exclude all my (bloat-cutting) edits and to grow an already 140,000 plus bytes article with his 'even more bad stuff about Hamas'.Haberstr (talk) 21:00, 10 September 2010 (UTC) X3D edit again[edit] Please take a look at the history of your talk section to see the discussion of X3D edits started by me and vandalized by others. The issues have been resolved, but you should see what my original comments sparked. 138.88.65.145 (talk) 20:21, 12 September 2010 (UTC) That's OK, but[edit] That's OK you undid my revision, because the one, who this edit was addressed to read it already, but you do not know the whole story to decide what is and what is not appropriate. Regards.--Mbz1 (talk) 21:47, 15 September 2010 (UTC) Well, you leaved me also curious. Why was it not appropriate? Iyow2 (talk) 21:57, 15 September 2010 (UTC) Actually I am much more curious why a confirmed sock of a banned user is not blocked, and continuing wikihounding me from page to page.--Mbz1 (talk) 22:00, 15 September 2010 (UTC) Notice that the last post is not after you but asking something to the owner of this talk page that did something unexpected in mine. Iyow2 (talk) 22:04, 15 September 2010 (UTC)  Duplicate warnings from Indexerbot[edit] I noted some duplicate warnings with the HBC Archive Indexerbot configs you have setup. I'm fixing these for you. The Indexerbot code snippet should only be placed in one place. In your situation I did left the code snippet in /Archive 1. --Kslotte (talk) 22:13, 15 September 2010 (UTC) An example of the code snippet removal. --Kslotte (talk) 22:25, 15 September 2010 (UTC) That's a bit odd. Thanks for fixing it! PeterSymonds (talk) 07:31, 16 September 2010 (UTC)  Block of User:Sourcedinfo on hold[edit] I'm not sure I get this one Peter. Looking at the uploads he was making just before being blocked, he did identify where he was getting them from and filled out the required fields on the FUR. Beeblebrox (talk) 17:50, 16 September 2010 (UTC) The main issue here was uploading replaceable non-free files, the first batch I deleted. I sent the user an e-mail as it seemed more appropriate given some of the claims, explaining what the problems were, but they were reuploaded. The user then sent me an e-mail requesting clarification, explaining that some of them were owned outright, but this seemed highly improbable. But I gave a link to the OTRS e-mail address in case he wanted to declare them. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:11, 16 September 2010 (UTC) I thought I had at least a halfway decent understanding of our policies in this area but I'm still not sure I get where you are coming from here. They were album covers, were labeled as such, and seemed to have proper FURs. If he was claiming on the file description page that he owned the images I could see it, but they were clearly tagged as non-free album covers downloaded from IMDB. I'm sorry if I'm being dense here, I'm just trying to see exactly how this is blockable. Beeblebrox (talk) 18:28, 16 September 2010 (UTC) Well, he was uploading album covers and claiming them as his own; I deleted them and sent an e-mail explaining why I deleted them and why he couldn't use them on that article (as fair-use album covers should really be limited to articles about the album or song). He then re-uploaded them with the same rationale for the same article. That prompted the block, as I've so far had no acknowledgement of my e-mail or the follow-up. PeterSymonds (talk) 18:44, 16 September 2010 (UTC) Ok, thanks for your patience with my thick head, I think I got you now. I've declined the unblock. Beeblebrox (talk) 21:33, 16 September 2010 (UTC)    Rollback proposal[edit] WikiTome · (talk · contribs · deleted · cross-wiki · wikichecker · count · pages created · logs · block log · lu · rfar · rfc · rfcu · ssp · spi · search an, ani, cn, an3) (assign permissions) I have been working on Wikipedia to revert vandalism for a while now, although I took a break recently because it was too time consuming. Now I find myself with more time, and would like to continue by using Huggle so I can clean things up faster. As I need rollback privileges to use Huggle, I would be really grateful if you could assign them to me. Thanks so much. WikiTome Talk 17:52, 20 September 2010 (UTC)  Moot Already handled at WP: RFP/R. —Soap— 19:09, 20 September 2010 (UTC)  Explanation of John P. Costas (business) edit[edit] Hi - can you explain your cryptic edit summary relating to the following edit to John P. Costas (business). Further, are you supporting removal of this text? I think it would be a stretch to make a case that there is a WP:BLP issue - this is directly from a Bloomberg article and it is couched as UBS's reporting of their own losses. This is not a comment about the Costas himself but rather a loss-making division of UBS that was shuttered during the financial crisis. This editor is a major WP:COI issue as an admitted former Dillon Read Capital Management trader. |? ?r?an?ene?a? • TALK ?| 14:59, 24 September 2010 (UTC) There were several reasons why I asked you to e-mail me as it's not something I'm prepared to discuss publicly. I'll send you an e-mail. PeterSymonds (talk) 15:15, 24 September 2010 (UTC)Actually I can't, since you don't have it enabled. Is there any chance you can enable it? Thanks. PeterSymonds (talk) 15:29, 24 September 2010 (UTC) I have enabled a new separate e-mail account as I feel uncomfortable having to do this outside of wikipedia. Please let me know when you have e-mailed so I can go check this account. |? ?r?an?ene?a? • TALK ?| 18:09, 24 September 2010 (UTC)  You have mail. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:40, 24 September 2010 (UTC)  You stated that you had received email confirmation previously. Image up for deletion though[edit] Padguy = Peter David[edit] You said you already confirmed his identity. [7] Someone tried to delete something he gave permission to use. I added the link to the OST ticket you mentioned, but the automatic template doesn't say its confirmed. [8] Can you please confirm his identity there, and replace it with whatever template is necessary? The talk page has more evidence of his identity and he gives permission to publish the article there. He also did it in an email he sent me, that I forwarded to you guys. Will someone with access read both emails to confirm his identity, and that he did give permission to this? Dream Focus 17:54, 22 June 2010 (UTC) I'm bringing this up again since someone just nominated that page for deletion a second time. Can you confirm that you have read the email and confirmed it? How do I update the template to show that? You didn't answer last time, you gone for awhile, and no one else apparently handling these sorts of things. Dream Focus 16:31, 25 September 2010 (UTC) I had quite forgotten! I will look into the ticket and confirm it this evening. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:31, 27 September 2010 (UTC) Sorry, more technical issues. Erm, I think there is a little confusion here. I confirmed a ticket which identified the username to the real name, as that was a point of discussion and in need of clarification. This, however, is a totally different ticket, from somebody else, claiming that "he [Peter David] said it was fine". That is not appropriate and needs to be from the subject himself. As such, I cannot say the ticket is valid, because Peter David was not the one who sent the e-mail about that image. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 15:21, 1 October 2010 (UTC) If you have confirmed that Padguy = Peter David, then when Padguy says on his talk page that he is writing an article about the issue, and that anyone can use it, then doesn't that count as proof? [9] He mentions it'll be in his "But I Digress" article, and will concern the deletionists and be about the article of that actor, which in fact it was, and that anyone could publish it freely. And the email I forwarded was from Peter David, I asking specifically to upload it onto Wikipedia in that format, and he consenting. If there is no doubt whatsoever that permission was given, just by my discussion with him on his talk page alone, is that enough to keep the image?

Gigs (talk) 15:09, 27 September 2010 (UTC) User talk:Protector of Wiki[edit] I thought I'd draw your attention to the post-block discussion on the user's talk page, where the user is simply continuing to type all in caps and refer to admins as "mods" to further irk other users, and has indicated that they have no intention of complying with the community's request. They don't seem interested in filing an unblock request either, so it might be time to withdraw their talk page access. GiftigerWunsch [TALK] 08:23, 28 September 2010 (UTC) "Thank you for explaining your unsolicited opinions on this block. Leave it up to the mods." Well, this "mod" agrees completely with GW. If I'd kept assuming good faith for too much longer I was going to end up getting hit with another one of these. I don't care too much about being called a "mod", I don't care too much about the ALL CAPS, I don't care too much about POW's attitude... but taken together it's become obvious that this editor isn't here to get along with other editors, and is going to continue to use their talkpage to continue their game. TFOWR 08:47, 28 September 2010 (UTC) I have revoked the talk page access, and referred the editor to the mailing list should they wish to put in an unblock request -- PhantomSteve/talk|contribs\ 10:30, 28 September 2010 (UTC) I see, but isn't he allowed to e-mail an administrator and request an unblock that way? Should his e-mail access through his account also be blocked(, which by the way forces PoW to e-mail the unblock requests mailing list)? HeyMid (contributions) 14:57, 28 September 2010 (UTC) I didn't do that because as far as I am aware, he hasn't abused the email system. -- PhantomSteve/talk|contribs\ 15:07, 28 September 2010 (UTC) OK, then I of course understand why.

Accotink2 talk 01:13, 3 October 2010 (UTC) Query regarding responses[edit] PeterSymonds, if, in the future, for whatever reasons, one finds it difficult to get a response from you after requests, [10] [11] [12], what is a good way that you would suggest to get ahold of you, or a next step to take? Just curious because it did involved legitimate disruption to the project by a user that was subsequently indef-blocked. Would like to know what users should do if this type of situation crops up again. Post a new subsection to your talk page instead of posting to an older thread higher up on the page? File a repeat SPI investigation for the same user, but with the newly-discovered evidence? Email you? Would appreciate your advice. Thank you for your time. Cheers, -- Cirt (talk) 18:56, 4 October 2010 (UTC) I have already apologised. As you can see from my talk page, it's not like I routinely ignore comments posted there. Sometimes comments in an older thread get overlooked, because issues that I think are resolved get restarted. If it's an old(ish), and you haven't got a follow-up, just poke me again or start a new section. Once I see it, I'll respond. PeterSymonds (talk) 19:01, 4 October 2010 (UTC) Alright, in the future will try starting a new subsection at the bottom of your usertalk page, if it occurs again. Thank you for the advice. It is most appreciated. Cheers, -- Cirt (talk) 19:02, 4 October 2010 (UTC)  The Kitchen[edit] Hello, I'm wondering why you, and user jpgordon, have undone the recent edits I made to The Kitchen page? I work for the organization and we are in the process of updating it so it is accurate and consistent. Please let me know. Thank you, Justin Neal Justinbneal (talk) 15:28, 7 October 2010 (UTC) Hi Justin. Unfortunately your edit was a blatant advertisement of your company, which is specifically disallowed on this site. All edits must be entirely neutral in tone, and they also must be sourced. Take a look at a few other articles to get an impression of the tone expected on Wikipedia. Let me know if you need any further assistance. :-) Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 17:34, 7 October 2010 (UTC) Unprotection[edit] Hey there. Could you unprotect Template:Editor-review/editintro? I need to make some updates to it and test it in general to make it clearer and easier to understand. I think changing the protection to edit=autoconfirmed is sufficient, as this template is quite hard to find. Netalarmtalk 21:50, 8 October 2010 (UTC) Why not. Done. PeterSymonds (talk) 21:51, 8 October 2010 (UTC) Bigfoot page possible discrepancy[edit] Hi Peter, I see that you lock the Bigfoot page to prevent vandalism. I read an article on the BFRO webpage about one of the references cited in the article, currently footnote 66 which references a Swedish book, "Berömda Vidunder". The artcle is: http://www.bfro.net/REF/wikipedia_edit.asp Could you take their arguments and research into account on the statement and reference used. They are saying that the book used is not a scientific journal, which should preclude it from the "View among the scientific community" section.

However, the actual practices of their firm especially in the 2000s, undermined their conservative lending principles and reputations, especially in the wake of the housing crash in 2008.[4] The Sandlers are credited with the invention of the "Pick-A-Pay" mortgage that allowed borrowers to pay less than the interest due on their loan each month -- which increased the total amount owed by the borrower. Analysts place the blame on the near failure of Wachovia in the fall of 2008 on the "Pick-A-Pay" mortgage portfolio they acquired from the Sandler's firm.[5] Martin Eakes, the director of the Center for Responsible Lending, said that prepayment penalties would make it hard for cash-poor borrowers to refinance a loan for one with more manageable terms, and helped to get a law passed in North Carolina prohibiting such charges. The Sandlers supported prepayment penalties, acknowledging that lenders used the penalties to lock borrowers into “absolutely awful” loans, but saying that his firm used the penalties to fend off unethical brokers who enticed borrowers with low-interest-rate loans that often had hidden fees. Sandler described independent brokers as "the whores of the world”, nonetheless by 2006 independent brokers generated 60 percent of World Savings' loan business, and he claimed that he was compelled to do so because of brokers were a dominant force in the mortgage industry. World Savings was suppose to telephone applicants to ensure that they understood the terms of their loan, as a check on the representations that brokers made to borrowers, but these calls reached only about half of the borrowers. [6] End Quote I cannot understand what precisely the BLP concerns are? The information may be negative, but it is well sourced (mostly the New York Times). Please explain. Thanks, LN If you are going to not defend your editing (which do not seem to be based on any good reasons), I suggest you refrain from editing in the future. LuxNevada (talk) 17:04, 13 June 2011 (UTC) Hi. Did you read the edit summary for his protection edit? [14] It should also be noted that Peter is not the only admin who has found the article worthy of protection due to BLP issues. Killiondude (talk) 17:11, 13 June 2011 (UTC)   Yes, I did read the edit summary. As noted in my original now more than 8 month old post, the deleted text is sourced and does not violate BLP. LuxNevada (talk) 17:44, 13 June 2011 (UTC)  Mick[edit] I'm no fan of Mick (and have been the target of his invective a few times) and as usual his response was OTT, but he was baited unreasonably there. I suppose the ban from his talk page was bound to happen, but I think if left alone he might have thought better in the cold light of day. Not a complaint by the way, just a note. I have reverted the offensive point per WP:BAIT as don't think Mick's use of obscenities justifies the use against him even if the intent was ironic. --Snowded TALK 21:50, 31 October 2010 (UTC) Hi, your block modification has been undone and this is now being discussed at WP:ANI.  Sandstein  22:28, 31 October 2010 (UTC) I was apparently under the mistaken impression that actions such as these should be discussed with those who issued them. :-) Clearly I was wrong.

To kick things off, there will be a UK community IRC meeting at 1800 UTC, December 7, 2010 to discuss the future growth and developement of Wikimedia UK. Without huge community support and involvement, the chapter cannot be successful and to get the most out of it, get involved.

Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:35, 9 December 2010 (UTC) Certainly no apologies needed, just a difference of opinion. If anything, I'm probably more pessimistic than you that he's going to turn things around; I threatened last week to block indef, rather than the more lenient 1 week. But since he was blocked for a week, I think he needs all the feedback, and interaction with people less pessimistic than me, that he can get.

We want to conduct a study over the next couple months (with some resources from the Wikimedia Foundation) to help craft strategies to develop new users, to get data on exactly how our new users are finding their first, and later, experiences on Wikipedia and of course to help share the experiences of the experienced users who are here to find out what works, what doesn't and what resources they need to make their work easier. The plan at the moment is to have several groups of users, 1 group that is just followed (the control) and several other groups with guides who actively reach out and try to help them edit and join the community. I hope that you can help us as we get ready for the study start next month and help the new users once we start! You can find out more information and sign up on the project page and if you can think of anyone who might be interested please please PLEASE point them this way or let me know so I can reach out to them personally. I'm hoping to try and get some discussion going on the talk page as well especially ideas on what you're new user experience was etc. Jalexander--WMF 22:55, 3 February 2011 (UTC) Barnstar awarded![edit] The Admin's BarnstarThanks for helping out at WP:RFPP :) ?™ 13:25, 5 February 2011 (UTC) The PeterSymond's song.[edit]  <Addihockey10> spidey peter, spidey peter   <Addihockey10> Splitting images like spidey peter does.   <Addihockey10> Can he delete?

One of the classes working with the Wikipedia Ambassador Program, Jonathan Obar's Media and Telecommunication Policy, is working in small groups and would like us to assign a mentor to each group (rather than having students request the mentors they'd like, as other classes are doing). I invite you to sign on as the mentor for one or more groups, especially if any of the topics catch your interest. To sign up, go to the course page and add yourself as "Mentor: you" in the section for that group. They students and/or professor or campus ambassadors should be cleaning things up soon to list all the usernames for each group and add a few more groups. Once you know who the students are in the group, you can leave them each a quick introduction to let them know you'll be mentoring their group. Thanks!--Sage Ross - Online Facilitator, Wikimedia Foundation (talk) 19:05, 22 February 2011 (UTC) I'll study the topics over the next day or two. None of it is really within my knowledge base, but I'll sign up if I see something I can contribute to meaningfully.

If this was intentional, could you please close the discussion and explain your reasoning? (Or if it was a mistake, perhaps reverse it.) Thanks,--Kotniski (talk) 18:15, 25 February 2011 (UTC) Hi Kotniski. I only moved the page because my admin tools were needed to do it. Somebody else performed the close. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 18:20, 25 February 2011 (UTC) OK, the events actually seemed to happen in the reverse order, hence the confusion. It seems clear now (though I can't say I entirely follow the closer's reasoning).--Kotniski (talk) 11:48, 26 February 2011 (UTC) Ah, I see what you mean about the timings. Odd. :-) Let me know the outcome of further discussions if they take place. PeterSymonds (talk) 23:27, 26 February 2011 (UTC)   Michael Tsarion[edit] A great many of us are trying to get information not available in the corporate media. Why have you deleted the page of Michael Tsarion? He has been a guest on Coast-to-Coast AM on multiple occasions and you find him not "Notable"? That show averages 4.5 Million! listeners. I must assume you are a Christian and find him offensive as many people have wiki pages who have not been heard by 4.5 million people. Yes I know you are not accountable to anyone and Wikipedia is completely independent of any oversight. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Psychicattorney (talk • contribs) 07:41, 26 February 2011 (UTC) Hi there. The article was deleted per Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Tsarion (2nd nomination). These community deletion discussions last for seven days, and the outcome is determined by an administrator (me, in this case). This decision seems to have been upheld. If you still disagree with the outcome, you can file a review of my closure, but at the present stage it would be best to draft a solid, sourced article in your user space to show how notability / sourcing has changed since the deletion. See the article wizard for some good advice about this. Best, PeterSymonds (talk) 23:31, 26 February 2011 (UTC) Hi.

I have one more request to ask of you. There's a user who I've crossed paths with on a few articles who finds it necessary to make frequent uncivil remarks to other users in his summaries. I brought it up for review at on the Wikiquette alerts page, where he claims to be sorry but still doesn't seem to be getting the point that people making changes to his edits does not warrant uncivil behavior. The only "moderation" I've seen was the guy you just banned for sockpuppetry who only got involved because he was also brought up for uncivil behavior under his original user name on the same page. Not looking to get people banned. I would just like another person, with an understanding of the rules, to step in and moderate. The discussion is located at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#User:Calgarykid47. Thanks.

This is a quick message to all the ambassadors about marking and tracking which articles students are working on. For the classes working with the ambassador program, please look over any articles being worked on by students (in particular, any ones you are mentoring, but others who don't have mentors as well) and do these things: Add {{WAP assignment | term = Spring 2011 }} to the articles' talk pages. (The other parameters of the {{WAP assignment}} template are helpful, so please add them as well, but the term = Spring 2011 one is most important.)If the article is related to United States public policy, make sure the article the WikiProject banner is on the talk page: {{WikiProject United States Public Policy}}Add Category:Article Feedback Pilot (a hidden category) to the article itself. The second phase of the Article Feedback Tool project has started, and this time we're trying to include all of the articles students are working on. Please test out the Article Feedback Tool, as well. The new version just deployed, so any bug reports or feedback will be appreciated by the tech team working on it. And of course, don't forget to check in on the students, give them constructive feedback, praise them for positive contributions, award them {{The WikiPen}} if they are doing excellent work, and so on. And if you haven't done so, make sure any students you are mentoring are listed on your mentor profile.

Delivered by EdwardsBot (talk) 22:26, 21 March 2011 (UTC) Your help sought as WikiGuide[edit] Dear Peter. In recent days I have been involved in a really rather nasty little stoush on the astrology page. Part of that involved some admins banning several editors for warring, sock puppetry, etc. One of the editors banned was Costmary, with whom I've had some dialogue. I am convinced that Costmary is a new editor who was sucked into an incredibly manipulative, destructive edit war as his/her very first experience as an editor. I have been trying to persuade him/her not to take that experience as indicative, and to continue contributing, but I'm not entirely certain that I am getting through because I could be seen as an 'opponent' when it comes to the astrology controversy. Nevertheless, I think that Costmary's heart is in the right place, and with a few kind words, some advice on where to look for help and assistance, this editor could become a long-term asset to Wikipedia. I wonder whether you could drop by the talk page for this editor and just say Hi, offer to be a bit of a friend in explaining how things work at WP, etc. Is that the sort of request I can make of you as a WikiGuide? Regards Peter S Strempel | Talk 23:04, 23 March 2011 (UTC) Request to mentor a small group of students[edit] Hi Peter!

If so, please sign up on the course page and introduce yourself to the students in the group. If not, let me know so I can find someone else.

In his unblock request, he says something about you giving him permission to edit: "I talked to Peter Symonds and explained the problem to him, and he has given me permission to edit the article." If interested, you are welcome to comment there. My concern was, the IPs broke 3RR, then the editor dusted off his registered account so that he could keep adding his views to the article in spite of the semiprotection. Thank you, EdJohnston (talk) 17:45, 1 April 2011 (UTC) Access to deleted content[edit] Hello Peter, I came to Wikipedia looking for an article on Raymond Aaron, and found the article that had been up was deleted by you in 2009. As a researcher/commentator in the success coaching field, I have no affiliation with Aaron or his organization, but feel it would be helpful to the public to have an article about him available here. My question is: if I should decide I have the time to take on the task, would it be possible to access the content of the deleted article on which to base a revised, objective one?

(The page was showing up on Category:Pages with incorrect formatting templates use and I assumed it was because it did not support the "nocategory" argument - but it does). Maybe the page only needed a purge... Long story short, you can put the protection back. Thanks and sorry.     — SkyLined (talk) 22:27, 14 June 2011 (UTC)  Hey, maybe this has something to do with my edit to the page.

I notice you blocked 4.247.128.128/25 for five years citing it's a Church of Scientology IP. But the reverse DNS suggests its dialup addresses in Tampa FL:  alison@nyancat:~$ host 4.247.128.128 128.128.247.4.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer dialup-4.247.128.128.Dial1.Tampa1.Level3.net. alison@nyancat:~$ host 4.247.128.255 255.128.247.4.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer dialup-4.247.128.255.Dial1.Tampa1.Level3.net.  My past experience with being on PeoplePC dialup (part of Earthlink) suggests that they use Level3 addresses in 4.128.0.0/9. They are dynamic and change by each dial-in. So... since these are obviously not CoS addresses I'd like to unblock them, but I though I would get your opinion as the blocking admin first.

(Talk) 00:56, 23 July 2011 (UTC) Iron Realms Entertainment and Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands[edit] (I accidentally put this on another editors talk page before I realized he was taking a wikibreak, sorry if that is bad form, but I cannot find his page now to delete it. :() I originally edited the pages for these two companies: Iron Realms Entertainment This was edited to include the multitude of complaints filed against the company; sources were cited, with links, that evidenced the information that I added to the article. Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands This was edited to include the above complaints as well as a direct information from an ex-representative of the company that was leveled at the company itself, again, I included links to both the complaints and to an archived version of the full information provided by the ex-representative. The company reverted my edits because they reflected poorly upon them. I do not think that Wikipedia is necessarily a consumer group, but it is not an advertising board, either. I believe that the information that I provided is both of interest to prospective readers of the article and should not be edited away simply because the company wants their article to present them only in a flattering way. The company editing their own wiki page to remove truthful and documented facts that happen to be unflattering is a clear conflict of interest.

We're heading toward over 80 classes in the US, across all disciplines. You'll see courses start popping up here, and this time we want to match one or more Online Ambassadors to each class based on interest or expertise in the subject matter. If you see a class that you're interested, please contact the professor and/or me; the sooner the Ambassadors and professors get in communication, the better things go. Look for more in the coming weeks about next term. In the meantime, with a little help I've identified all the articles students did significant work on in the last term. Many of the articles have never been assessed, or have ratings that are out of date from before the students improved them. Please help assess them! Pick a class, or just a few articles, and give them a rating (and add a relevant WikiProject banner if there isn't one), and then update the list of articles. Once we have updated assessments for all these articles, we can get a better idea of how quality varied from course to course, and which approaches to running Wikipedia assignments and managing courses are most effective. --Sage Ross - Online Facilitator, Wikimedia Foundation (talk) 17:28, 27 July 2011 (UTC) Please review the Rescue Tag template or documentation[edit] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Rescue#Linking_to_other_deletion_.28Xfd.29_discussions -- Avanu (talk) 17:11, 6 August 2011 (UTC) Cassandra Hepburn[edit] Hi Peter--Your name was included in the Wiki entry for Cassandra Hepburn because you blocked someone who raised questions about the actress's age.

If you're planning to be an active Online Ambassador for the upcoming academic term, now is the time to join one or more pods. (A pod consists of the instructor, the Campus Ambassadors, and the Online Ambassadors for single class.) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) explains the expectations for being part of a pod as an Online Ambassador. (The MOU for pods in Canada is essentially the same.) In short, the role of Online Ambassadors this term consists of: Working closely with the instructor and Campus Ambassadors, providing advice and perspective as an experienced WikipedianHelping students who ask for it (or helping them to find the help they need)Watching out for the class as a wholeHelping students to get community feedback on their work This replaces the 1-on-1 mentoring role for Online Ambassadors that we had in previous terms; rather than being responsible for individual students (some of whom don't want or help or are unresponsive), Online Ambassadors will be there to help whichever students in their class(es) ask for help. You can browse the upcoming courses here: United States; Canada. More are being added as new pods become active and create their course pages. Once you've found a class that you want to work with—especially if you some interest or expertise in the topic area—you should sign the MOU listing for that class and get in touch with the instructor. We're hoping to have at least two Online Ambassadors per pod, and more for the larger classes. If you're up for supporting any kind of class and would like me to assign you to a pod in need of more Online Ambassadors, just let me know. --Sage Ross - Online Facilitator, Wikimedia Foundation (talk) 16:34, 19 August 2011 (UTC) PS: There are still a lot of student articles from the last term that haven't been rated.

I wanted to give you one last update on where we are this term, before my role as Online Facilitator wraps up at the end of this week. Already, there are over 800 students in U.S. classes who have signed up on course pages this term. About 40 classes are active, and we're expecting that many more again once all the classes are up and running. On a personal note, it's been a huge honor to work with so many great Wikipedians over the last 15 months. Thanks so much to everyone who jumped in and decided to give the ambassador concept a try, and double thanks those of you who were involved early on. Your ideas and insights and enthusiasm have been the foundation of the program, and they will be the keys the future of the program. Courses looking for Online Ambassadors[edit] Still waiting to get involved with a class this term, or ready to take on more?

Thanks, Maryana (WMF) (talk) 21:34, 7 November 2011 (UTC) Help?[edit] Hi, I'm writing about something that may or may not be against Wikipedia policy. There's a professor on Wikipedia (User:ToniSant) who is telling his students to create Wikipedia pages for a project. That in itself isn't automatically a negative thing, but most of the pages have been deleted via the AfD process. This means that it's much more work for everyone as far as going through the whole AfD process goes, sometimes for the same page over and over again. A look at his user page shows that he's told his students to recreate pages that were previously added in prior semesters and were deleted. He's also telling them to add to various pages and I notice that some of those revisions have been reverted due to various reasons. It's a little bit of a disruptive presence, to be honest. I've left a message on the professor's page mentioning that this might not be the most beneficial way to do this and leaving suggestions for other ways to do similar things (such as starting their own Wikia site or going through AfC) and they haven't had a chance yet to say anything in return, but I just wanted to drop a note to an admin and let them know what is going on. There's nothing against making pages for grades in Wikipedia rules per se, but it's something that I just feel isn't really all that right. I'm going to notify another user who seems to have reverted a few of their pages, but I just wanted to drop you a note. I noticed all of this after a page was put up for AfD (Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Digital Performance (2nd nomination)) and one of the students commented that it was done for a student project per her professor.

As you may know, the Wikipedia Education Program has instilled a new set of standards that courses must meet to officially join the program for the semester. As you can see, one of the requirements is that at least one ambassador or professor is a Wikipedian, as this should give students more access to helpful information about contributing to Wikipedia and creating good content. You are listed on the Online Ambassador page; are you still interested in remaining active this semester? Some of these classes will have to remove themselves from the program should they fail to meet these standards, but we would like to ensure that new students are receiving proper support during the editing process. Please let me know if you are still interested in mentoring these students this semester and/or visit the Online Ambassador talk page to select a course that still needs an Online Ambassador.

This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community, and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.  So a few things about the interviews: Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.  Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name HERE instead. If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you. Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Bob Giltinian is a retired professional tennis player who made the Semifinals of the December Australian open in 1977, as a qualifier. There is an article for him in French Wikipedia, but not English wikipedia. I am unsure why you deleted the page before as 'not notable', because he is notable. I am going to recreate his page.

However, there is an account Nmate on IRC created yesterday which is unlikely to be of mine. It is likely to have been created by the banned user:Iaaasi for the purpose of teasing. I have no proof of it, it is just an inkling. I have tried to create one another account to which I also requested for a cloack, inappropriately. Sorry about that. I have no patient to figure out how to create an account there. I just hope that the user who has created the account there does not want to discredit me. Unless I did anything that I was not aware of, the account Nmate is not mine on the IRC channel, leastways; I have no access to it.--Nmate (talk) 13:07, 24 March 2012 (UTC) Invitation to the Berlin hackathon on Wikimedia technology[edit] Peter, I invite you to the yearly Berlin hackathon, 1-3 June.

It seems to have been closed down becuase there is no clear blue water between consutlative selling and selling something. The difference is between what happens when IBM sells a $50M contract to GM and you buy a printer from HP. One is a commodity, and the other requires mapping of a companies services and products onto a customer need. The current articles imply there is a product there is a need and the buyer maps their needs onto that of the seller. Consultative selling is when you are selling something that can change dependant on the customer. The seller positions, changes and perhaps re-designs their offering based on the solution a customer wants. It requires understanding customer need, understanding what the seller has then finding a fit. You have to look at this as if no seller has 100% fit for customer requirement and perhaps all sellers have an 80% fit for customer need and the customer still has to choose. Not only is there a lot of litreature on the topic, there are also a large number of training courses on this, and businesses that rely on this model - from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and many more. Books include:- Consultative Selling Advanced, Sixth Edition: The Hanan Formula for High-Margin Sales at High Levels AND Consultative Closing: Simple Steps That Build Relationships and Win Even the Toughest Sale AND Relationship Selling: The Fine Art Of Consultative Sales [Paperback] AND SPIN Selling - none of which I am an author of. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Mikepilcher (talk • contribs) 12:56, 16 July 2012 (UTC) request for semi protection of user page[edit] Would firmly request you to please protect my page from vandalism and inappropriate interference.user page:Pratik Nayek.Thankyou — Preceding unsigned comment added by Pratik Nayek (talk • contribs) 21:54, 21 August 2012 (UTC) Hi[edit] You are a very sweet boy/man good luck with everything kiss on your left cheek yes I am a girl dont worry :) Keep on rocking — Preceding unsigned comment added by 182.178.71.24 (talk) 06:03, 22 August 2012 (UTC) The 3O page seems broken since the move that you did for Steven Zhang[edit] ... and he's away on vacation.

You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here. Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course. If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything. Please do these steps as soon as possible First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible. Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at: Special:CampusAmbassadorProfileSpecial:OnlineAmbassadorProfile Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list). After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists "Current" courses, but you can change the Status filter to "Planned" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.) As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here. Communication and keeping up to date In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program: The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the #wikipedia-en-ambassadors connect IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors. Ambassador training and resources We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.) Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where the Ambassadors fit in, or if you want to review and help improve it. If there's something you'd like to see added, or other suggestions you have for it, feel free to edit the training and/or leave feedback. A primer on setting up and using course pages is included in the educators' training. The Resources page of the training is the main place for Ambassador-related resources. If there's something you think is important as a resource that's not on there, please add it. Finally, whether or not you work with any classes this term, I encourage you to post entries to the Trophy Case whenever you see excellent work from students or if you have great examples from past semesters. And, as always, let students (and other editors!) know when they do things well; a little WikiLove goes a long way! --Sage Ross (WMF) (talk) 20:55, 14 January 2013 (UTC) IRC Chat[edit] Hi, Maybe you can help I totally forgot my password for irc my Irc name is the same as my name on here.
