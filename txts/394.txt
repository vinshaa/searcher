The paragraph that was here was really old so I've erased it all. Now you won't get to know ANYTHING about me! Muhahahaha   Contributions   Feel free to look at my galleries:  Wikipedia image galleryWikimedia Commons image gallery    Most of my contributions are images. I primarily make scalable vector graphics and upload them to Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. Here are just a few of my free contributions to Wikimedia Commons:   I have also: created multiple userboxes that you should definitely check out!created the sad panda template for new users without barnstarsuploaded over 50 television station/show vector logosuploaded many restaurant logos, such as McDonalds, Wendy's, and Harvey'suploaded multiple airline logosuploaded any other company logos I can think ofcorrected many random grammatical, spelling, layout, and typographical errorscreated that digital clock up at the top somewhere...uploaded multiple other raster and vector graphics  Although I believe in quality not quantity, apparently edit count = experience, so here it is. All article contributions from this account, and my old account. All image contributions from this account, and my old account.  Recent barnstars  The SVG Designer's BarnstarYou are way overdue for an award; you have an extremely huge collection of high-visibility uploads that are vital and used all over Wikipedia. You have hundreds of uploads not including those uploaded on your other accounts. This is just a small token of appreciation from Wikipedians everywhere -- penubag  (talk) 04:26, 13 April 2008 (UTC) The Original BarnstarThank you for uploading all of those .SVGs. Keep it up!!! DB9 (talk) 20:44, 26 April 2008 (UTC) The Excellent Userpage AwardExcellent work with designing your userpage. It's very neat and organized. I was surprised that you hadn't recieved this award. Your userpage is a lot better than mine    Juthani1   tcs 17:25, 1 June 2008 (UTC) The Minor BarnstarYou have been awarded this barnstar for one of the greatest things a person can do on wikipedia: listening to requests, such as what you did with the minor changes to the Windows Vista and Windows 7 SVG images. It's rare for someone to be bothered to do these simple but important changes, so thank you. Meph (talk) 20:04, 3 April 2009 (UTC)          This is me. I'll probably change this photo from time to time. Perchance. Hmm... Check out the SAD PANDA!     Userboxes     It is approximately 7:40 PM where this user lives.
