(May 2009) SAP NetWeaver is the primary technology computing platform of the software company SAP SE, and the technical foundation for many SAP applications. It is a solution stack of SAP's technology products. The SAP Web Application Server (sometimes referred to as WebAS) is the runtime environment for the SAP applications, and all of the mySAP Business Suite solutions (SRM, CRM, SCM, PLM, ERP) run on SAP WebAS. The product is marketed as a service-oriented application and integration platform. It can be used for custom development and integration with other applications and systems, and is built primarily using the ABAP programming language, but also uses C (programming language), C++, and Java EE. It can also be extended with, and interoperate with, technologies such as Microsoft .NET, Java EE, and IBM WebSphere.

The founder of TopTier Software Shai Agassi joined SAP and was given responsibility for the company's overall technology strategy and execution. He initiated the development of the integration and application platform that became the NetWeaver platform.[1] SAP announced the first release, NetWeaver 2004, in January 2003, and it was made available on March 31, 2004.[2][3] NetWeaver 7.0, also known as 2004s, was made available on October 24, 2005.[4] The latest available release is SAP NetWeaver 7.4 SP 10.[5]  SAP NetWeaver Application ServerSAP NetWeaver Business IntelligenceSAP NetWeaver Composition Environment (CE)SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal (EP)SAP NetWeaver Identity Management (IdM)SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management (MDM)SAP NetWeaver MobileSAP NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) SAP has also worked with the computer hardware vendors HP, IBM, Fujitsu and Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation) to deliver hardware and software for the deployment of NetWeaver components. Examples of these appliances include BW Accelerator and Enterprise Search. Development tools for NetWeaver include ABAP Workbench (SE80), SAP NetWeaver Developer Studio (NWDS) based on Eclipse for most of the Java part of the technology (Web Dynpro for Java, JEE, Java Dictionary, portal applications etc.), SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (NWDI) and Visual Composer.
