List of Apache modules                    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia           (Redirected from Mod php)                   Jump to:     navigation,      search           This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.  In computing, Apache, an open-source HTTP server, comprises a small core for HTTP request/response processing and for Multi-Processing Modules (MPM) which dispatches data processing to threads and/or processes. Many additional modules (or "mods"[1] ) are available to extend the core functionality for special purposes. The following is a list of all the first- and third-party modules available for the Apache web server: NameCompatibilityStatusDeveloper(s)LicenseDescriptionmod_accessVersions older than 2.1Included by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Provides access control based on the client and the client's request[2]mod_actionsVersions 1.1 and laterIncluded by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Provides CGI ability based on request method and media type[3]mod_aliasVersions 1.1 and laterIncluded by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Allows for client requests to be mapped to different parts of a server's filesystem and for the requests to be redirected entirely[4]mod_asisVersions 1.3 and laterIncluded by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Allows for the use of files that contain their own HTTP headers[5]mod_aspdotnetApache License, Version 2.0No longer under the Apache Software Foundation umbrella. Development has been resumed by the original authors at its new home, the mod-aspdotnet SourceForge project.mod_authVersions older than 2.1Included by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Authenticates users via Basic access authentication by checking against plaintext password and group files. In Apache 2.1 and later, this plaintext authentication is enabled by mod_authn_file instead.[6]mod_auth_anonVersions 1.1-2.1Stable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Allows authentication with a special user id of 'anonymous' and an email address as the password. As an authentication mechanism, this was replaced by mod_authn_anon.[7]mod_auth_basicVersions 2.1 and newerIncluded by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Authenticates users via HTTP Basic Authentication, the backend mechanism for verifying user authentication is left to configurable providers, usually other Apache modules. This module replaces the authentication frontend of several older modules.[8]mod_auth_dbVersions 1.1-1.3Stable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Provides user authentication using Berkeley DB files.mod_auth_dbmVersions older than 2.1Stable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0This module provides for HTTP Basic Authentication, where the usernames and passwords are stored in DBM type database files. It is an alternative to the plain text password files provided by mod_auth.mod_auth_digestVersions 1.3.8 and newerStable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Authenticates users via HTTP Digest Authentication utilizing MD5 encryption. This is more secure than HTTP Basic Authentication provided by other modules. As of Apache 2.1, this module acts as a front-end to authentication providers who verify the actual login.[9]mod_auth_kerbmod_auth_ldapVersions 2.0.41-2.1Experimental ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Allows HTTP Basic Authentication by checking against an LDAP directory. The authentication mechanism of checking against an LDAP directory is provided via mod_authnz_ldap in Apache versions 2.1 and later.mod_auth_oidVersion 2.2Third-party modulePascal BuchbinderGNU General Public License, Version 2Allows an Apache server to act as an OpenID "Relying Party"[10]mod_authn_aliasVersion 2.1 and newerStable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0This module allows extended authentication providers to be created within the configuration file and assigned an alias name. The alias providers can then be referenced through the directives AuthBasicProvider or AuthDigestProvider in the same way as a base authentication provider.mod_authn_anonVersion 2.1 and newerStable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Acts as an authentication provider to other modules, like mod_auth_basic and mod_auth_digest, users are authenticated by using a special user id of "anonymous" and providing their email as the password.[11]mod_authn_dbdVersion 2.1 and newerStable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0This module provides authentication front-ends such as mod_auth_digest and mod_auth_basic to authenticate users by looking up users in SQL tables. Similar functionality is provided by, for example, mod_authn_file.mod_authn_dbmVersion 2.1 and newerStable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0This module provides authentication front-ends such as mod_auth_digest and mod_auth_basic to authenticate users by looking up users in dbm password files. Similar functionality is provided by mod_authn_file.mod_authn_defaultVersion 2.1 and newerIncluded by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0This module is designed to be the fallback module, if you don't have an authentication module like mod_auth_basic configured. It simply rejects any credentials supplied by the user.mod_authn_fileVersion 2.1 and newerIncluded by DefaultApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Acts as an authentication provider to other modules, like mod_auth_basic and mod_auth_digest, by checking users against plaintext password files.[12]mod_authnz_externalmod_authnz_ldapVersion 2.1 and newerStable ExtensionApache Software FoundationApache License, Version 2.0Acts as an authentication provider to other modules and checks authentication against an LDAP directorymod_authnz_mysqlVersion 2.2This module provides both authentication and authorization for the Apache 2.2 webserver like mod-authnz-ldap .
