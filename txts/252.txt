(August 2009)  mod_jk is an Apache module used to connect the Tomcat servlet container with web servers such as Apache, iPlanet, Sun ONE (formerly Netscape) and even IIS using the Apache JServ Protocol. A web server waits for client HTTP requests. When these requests arrive the server does what is needed to serve the requests by providing the necessary content. Adding a servlet container alters this behavior. Now the web server needs also to: Load the servlet container adapter library and initialize it (prior to serving requests).When a request arrives, it needs to check and see if a certain request belongs to a servlet, if so it needs to let the adapter take the request and handle it. The adapter needs to know what requests it is going to serve, usually based on some pattern in the request URL, and to where to direct these requests. Things are more complex when the user wants to set a configuration that uses virtual hosts, or when they want multiple developers to work on the same web server but on different servlet container JVMs. See also[edit]  Free software portalJava portal  JSPJava ServletJava platformmod_perlmod_pythonmod_wsgimod_phpmod_cgi External links[edit] Tomcat DocumentationTomcat How-to guide    vte  Web interfaces Server-side   Protocols   CGISCGIFCGIAJPWSRPWebSocket   Server APIs   C NSAPIC ASAPIC ISAPICOM ASPJava servlet container Portlet container CIL System.Web.IHttpHandlerPython WSGIRuby RackJavaScript JSGIPerl PSGILua WSAPIOWIN   Apache modules   mod_jkmod_lispmod_monomod_parrotmod_perlmod_phpmod_proxymod_pythonmod_wsgimod_rubyPhusion Passenger   Topics   Web resource vs. Web serviceOpen APIWebhookApplication server comparison    Client-side   Browser APIs   C NPAPI LiveConnectXPConnect C NPRuntimeC PPAPI NaCl ActiveX   Web APIs    W3C   AudioCanvasCORSFileGeolocationIndexedDBMicrodataSSESVGVideoWebRTCWebSocketWeb messagingWeb storageWeb workerXMLHttpRequest   Khronos   WebCLWebGL   Others   GearsWeb SQL Database (formerly W3C)    Topics   MashupWeb IDL      This computer networking article is a stub.
